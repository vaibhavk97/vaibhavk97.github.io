## Notes

* You should thoroughly understand the business of SaaS. This will let
  you make better decisions for your product (and company), allow you to
  see business-threatening problems months or years in advance of them
  being obvious, and help you in communicating with investors.

### Why is SaaS taking over the world?

* Customers love SaaS because it "just works". It's also cheaper.
* Developers love SaaS because of the delivery model -- no
  infrastructure to maintain, etc.
* Businesses and investors love SaaS because the economics are
  impossibly attractive relative to selling licenses. It's **recurring**
  and **predictable**

### SaaS sales models

* Very very important to match the product/market and the selected model
  to sell it on
  * Probably got this right. Pretty clearly high-touch enterprise SaaS

### High-touch SaaS sales

* When customers need help deciding whether or how to adopt certain
  products
* **Human-intensive process** to convince businesses to adopt the
  software
* **Sales teams are the beating heart of the organization**
  * **SDR**: Sales Development Representatives find prospects
  * **AE**: Account Executives own the sales process against particular
    customers
  * **AM**: Account Managers are responsible for happiness and continued
    performance of an individualized portfolio of accounts
* Marketing supports sales.
  * primary job: generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified leads for
    the sales team to evaluate and close
* **Sales engine is more important than engineering and product**
* **Highly utilized customer support**

### The fundamental equation of SaaS

* **revenue = customers * average lifetime revenue per customer**
* **customers = acquisition (eyeballs) * conversion rate**
* **LTV (lifetime value) = payment per period * periods of use**
* **ARPU (average revenue per user)** is average revenue for account
  over a period
* **Churn** is percent of customers over a given period who do not
  continue paying for services

### Implications of the SaaS business model

* **Improvements are multiplicative**: 10% better acquisition and 10%
  better conversion is a _21%_ improvement (1.1 * 1.1)
* **Improvements to a SaaS business are incredibly leveraged**...a 1%
  improvement in conversation rates is HUGE over the long run
* **Price is the easiest lever to improve a SaaS business** (see SaaS
  pricing guide)
* **SaaS businesses take a while to grow**

### Benchmarks to know

* **Churn rates**: 10% annualized churn is reasonable for early
  companies. 7% is excellent. High-touch SaaS always has lower churn
  than low-touch SaaS.
* **Net revenue churn** is good to track in addition to raw account
  churn
* **Negative net revenue churn** is the holy grail: upgrades, increases
  in contract size more than offset revenue impact of customers
  terminating use of software

### Product/market fit

* **Have you found a group of people who _love_ the thing you have built
  for them?**
* Lots of companies do not launch with product/market fit, they have to
  find it.
* Need to find high conversion, low churn. Makes everything easier.
