## Notes

* Equality of outcome sucks
  * If you have freedom equality of outcome is not possible
  * Inequality/concentration of resources is natural. Sports, nature,
    population
  * How much tyranny do you need to impose to create equality of outcome?
* There are differences between men and women! Four decades has been
  accepted as fact
* Liberals start companies conservatives run companies. Need each other.
  * Conservatives will maximize efficiency
* **Better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war**
* Don't feel good about who you are, feel good about who you could be.
  Participation trophies are bad.
* Outline your heaven and hell. This will motivate you
* People want optimal challenge, not complete relaxation
* How much better would the world be if everyone stopped making it worse
* Toxic tribalism leads to bloodshed
* Very very self critical. 15 years to write his book maps of
  meaning. Rewrote each sentence 15x!
