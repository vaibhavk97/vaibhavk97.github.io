## Notes

* Guest: Atul Gawander. Surgeon, author.
* What does restaurant do better than hospital? Quality control, cost
  control, innovation in service
  * Also massively less complex
* Universal healthcare is a massive ambitious project. Average of 8
* procedures. Everyone is born. **60k maladies 6k drugs**
  * "Most ambitious ever" seems like a misnomer but w/e
* Bad feedback loop for surgeons. Little to no follow up

  important but pay etc doesn't reflect that because they aren't as
  "visible"
