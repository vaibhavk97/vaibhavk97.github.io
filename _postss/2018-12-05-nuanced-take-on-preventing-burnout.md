## Notes

* Burnout is like a **kettle**, and you can keep it going by letting steam out
  occasionally
* My burnout prevention technique has two components to it: detection and
  corrective action.
* Detection is actually really easy. Once a week, introspect and ask yourself:
  “Do I feel resentful?” This works remarkably well, because resentment is the
  first sign of burnout.
* Maslach Burnout Inventory: ICE
  * Inefficacy: reduced personal accomplishment
  * Cynicism: negative attitudes
  * Exhaustion: loss of energy, fatigue
* Do restful activity that's actually restful.
