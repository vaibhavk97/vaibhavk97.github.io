## Notes

* Michael Pollan
* Psychidelics are tools
* Lots of studies of psychidelics for prescription. Few years out
* No microdosing studies yet
* Locks on to seratonin receptors in brain and gut
* Default mode network downregulated. theory of mind, sense of consistent self,
self reflection
* Afterwards, lots of new neural connections
* Trials are guided, therapist is with you
* Am I feeling contracted or expanded right now?
* Statistically significant decreases in depression and anxiety when patients
  with cancer are given sylocibin. Even after it wears off! 80%
