## Notes

* Intravenous stem cells in Panama. Regulate the immune system's
inflammatory process
* Feel like a new man
* Mesenchymal stem cells. From umbilical cord
  * Can help with autism? Inflammation
  * Have helped with shoulder pain, heart stuff
  * Tougher to do spine stuff because the spinal cage has very few stem
    cells by design. Can't get in there as effectively.
