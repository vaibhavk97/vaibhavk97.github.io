## Notes

* College is a resort and the students are the clients
* People take the worst possible interpretation of statements and turn them into
microaggressions
* Preference falsification: when private thoughts don't match public actions
everyone gets a distorted view of reality
* Cognitive distortions
* Moral dependence for new generation :/ don't solve it yourself
* Call out culture and victimhood culture: people standing up for others in
order to appear cool
* Angry self righteousness
* Call out culture
