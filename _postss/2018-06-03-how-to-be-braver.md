## Notes

* **Bravery is an attitude** not a physical activity
  * Acting in the face of fear not the absence of fear
* Culture types:
  * Culture of dignity: Western, individual is unit of measurement
  * Culture of honor: on stage, personal and family reputation
  * Culture of face: Chinese. Avoid personal embarrassment. Honor is about
    family reputation, culture of face is more individual
* How to be braver: **reduce fear and increase willingness to act**
* Lucky charm? Works for a lot of people!
* Watch out for self handicapping. Harming your chances in order to
  give yourself a built in excuse
