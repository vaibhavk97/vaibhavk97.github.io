## Notes

* Couple of examples where the author had an old script laying around
  and instead of porting/rewriting, he found a better open-source option
  to implement, saving a lot of time and headache.
* **Code is fun to write, but itâ€™s such a liability, especially if you
  have less time than when you initially wrote it. This is why I think
  so much time can be spent on automation or documentation; because it
  helps out future me. But the most foolproof way to win is to just not
  play, given the option.**
