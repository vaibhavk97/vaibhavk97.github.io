## Notes

_Usually the hardest thing is to get really great people to help you
grow the business. So I recommend that entrepreneurs--from the time they
get up in the morning to when they can't make any further progress-I
recommend that they spend all of their time recruiting, interviewing,
and trying to build diverse teams._
