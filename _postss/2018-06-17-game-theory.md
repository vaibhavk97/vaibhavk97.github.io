## Notes

* **Game theory**: The study of equilibria based solutions
  * Where neither party wants to leave their strategy
* Issues:
  * Assuming common knowledge is bad. Chess everyone has full state,
    most real-life scenarios all parties don't
* Your **discount factor** is the cost to you of a prolonged game. I.e. how
  much does it hurt you the longer it takes your house to sell
