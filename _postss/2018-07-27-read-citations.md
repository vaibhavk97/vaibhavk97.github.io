## Notes

* Dunning-Kruger: pop-sci treatment is that perceived ability is inversely
  correlated with actual ability. Graphs from original paper show this is
  blatantly wrong. Potential biases include American culture and sampling of
  students from Cornell undergraduates.
* Money and happiness: original studies have a logarithmic relationship. This
  became interpreted as flatlining which is wrong.
* Hedonic adaptation: lots of studies. Potentially similar reasons to
  misinterpretations of money/happiness.
