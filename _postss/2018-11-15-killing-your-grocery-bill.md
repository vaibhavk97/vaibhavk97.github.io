## Notes

* Let’s say a family of four wants to spend only $365 per month on groceries,
  saving them $579 per month over the USDA average family. Investing this
  savings would compound into about $102,483.00 every ten years, which would
  obviously make a pretty big improvement in the financial health of the
  average young family.
* 2012 dollars:
* Cost per 667 calorie “Meal” of common foods:
  * Basmati Rice: 25 cents
  * Spaghetti noodles: 28 cents
  * Black beans (uncooked): 49 cents
  * Natural (peanuts only) Peanut Butter: 53.36 cents
  * California Raw Almonds: 80 cents
  * Bananas: 92 cents
  * Potatoes: 57 cents
  * Canola Oil:  14.38 cents
  * Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil:  57 cents
  * Cheddar cheese: $1.09
  * Apples:  $2.79
  * Organic cage-free eggs:  $2.85
  * Organic boneless skinless chicken breast: $8.00
* Eat eggs, almonds, olive oil. Get cheap protein and fats. $/calorie is a good
  way of thinking about this
