## Notes

* Sam Walker
* Is there something that enables teams to succeed?
* Similarities between great teams?
* Talent was not common thread
* Tactics were not common thread
* Money was not common thread
* Coaching was not common thread
* The captain is the verb in the sentence. Makes the whole thing go
* The power of relentlessness. Only playing at one speed. Effort is contagious
* Captains stretch the rules. They want to find the best edge they can without getting caught
* How do you communicate? Constantly, democratically, intensely
