summary: "Mostly anecdotes and stories about how the 20s are high-stakes but not treated appropriately by people going through them. Entertaining read, not much actionable. Wish there was more data. Good reminders to get my ass into gear."

*TL;DR*: Mostly stories. Entertaining read, not much actionable. Good reminders
to get my ass into gear.

## Notes

* 80% of life's most significant events happen before 35

### Work

* 20-somethings are like airplanes. A small course change right after takeoff wlil
  make a huge difference. A small course change close to destination won't
  matter much
* **Identity capital**: collection of personal assets. Repertoire of individual
  resources we assemble over time. Investments in ourselves, things we do well
  enough that they become part of who we are
  * Resume pieces and personal pieces
  * Currency for purchasing jobs, relationships, other things we want
* You can't think your way through life
* Urbanization has killed weak ties
  * "Strength of Weak Ties" (Granovetter)
    * 75% of new jobs come from weak ties
  * Because they're not just figures in an already ingrown cluster, weak ties
    give us access to something fresh
* Ben Franklin effect: if someone does you a favor, they're more likely to think
  they like you
  * Behaviors shape attitudes
* **Unthought known**: we know about ourselves but we forget (dreams, truths,
  acknowledgements)

### Love

* Roulette
* Marrying later protects against divorce until about age 25
* People feel an "Age Thirty Deadline"
* Best time to work on marriage is before you have one
* YAVIS: young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, successful -- give advantages
  but makes it hard when you want to seek help
* You are **picking a family** when you get into relationships
* The **cohabitation effect** is that couples who live together before marriage
  are more likely to divorce than couples who do not
  * "Sliding, not deciding". Things get fuzzy
* Do a Big Five test with each other
* Be picky about stuff that matters in 20 years, not about everyday
  discrepancies

### The Brain and the Body

* Frontal lobe development in adolescence and 20s. Most neuroplastic you will
  ever be again
* If you don't feel anxious, you're either overconfident or underemployed
* Don't take things personally
* Confidence comes from mastery experiences
* Most personality change happens in 20s
* Fertility risks are real :(
  * Per-cycle odds of conception are 20-25% up to age 35
  * Sharp drop to 5% at 40
  * Miscarriages: 1/4 of after-35 pregnancies and 1/2 of after-40 pregnancies
* **Present bias**: people discount the future all the time
