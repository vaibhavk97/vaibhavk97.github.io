## Notes

* **It's all about connections**
  * Myth: new ideas are stored like files in a filing cabinet
  * Truth: new ideas have to connect with what's already there, like a
    jigsaw puzzle
* **Use it or lose it**
  * Myth: re-reading and cramming are effective
  * Truth: reCALL is much better. It's also better to space out your
    learning!
* **Connect deep**
  * Myth: highlighting and memorizing are good ways to learn
  * Truth: you have to process items on a deep level to make them stick.
