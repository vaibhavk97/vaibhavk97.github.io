summary: "Series of Buddhist-centric talks about life given by Pema Chodron. Generally too hand-wavy for me but good reminders of how to behave and live. Not heavily religious."

*TL;DR*: Hard to think of central theme. Titular talk was one of the
weaker ones, it basically described that when you are backed into a
corner you can find out who you really are by opening up and letting
things happen. Lots of stuff about self-acceptance.

## Notes

* Final talk: The Four Reminders
  * The first reminder is our precious birth and how much of a damn
    miracle it is
  * The second reminder is impermanence. The essence of life is
    fleeting.
  * The third reminder is karma. Every action has a result. We sow the
    seeds and we reap the fruit.
  * The fourth reminder is the futility of continuing to spin around on
    samsara. Don't fall into the trap of doing the same thing over and
    over and over again.
  * Together, these reminders can help us wake up when shit isn't going
    perfectly.

    Being satisfied with what we already have is a magical golden key to
    being alive in a full, unrestricted, and inspured way. (6)

    You were very god. You were very good right from the beginning, but
    I knew if I told you that you were good, you would stop trying. (10)

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Thereare three qualities that we can nurture, cultivate, and bring
    out. We already possess these, but they can be ripened: <b>precision,
    gentleness, and the ability to let go.</b> (13)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Being with the out-breath cultivates the <b>precision</b> of your
    mind, and when you label (say "thinking" to yourself), that too
    brings out the precision of your mind. (15)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    This is probably one of the most amazing tools that you could be
    given, the ability to just <b>let things go</b>, not to be caught up
    in the grip of your own angry thoughts or passionate thoughts or
    worried thoughts or depressed thoughts.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Resentment, bitterness, and holding a grudge prevent us from seeing
    and hearing and tasting and delighting. (25)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    There isn't any hell or heaven except for how we relate to our
    world. Hell is just resistance to life. [...] Life's work is to wake
    up, to <b>let the things that enter into the circle wake you up rather
    than put you to sleep.</b> (29)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>As soon as you begin to believe in something, then you can no
    longer see anything else. The truth you believe in and cling to
    makes you unavailable to hear anything new.</b> (32)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The first noble truth says simply that it's part of being human to
    feel discomfort. [...] The second noble truth says that this
    resistance is the fundamental operating mechanism of what we call
    ego, that resisting life causes suffering. [...] The third noble
    truth says that the cessation of suffering is letting go of holding
    on to ourselves. [...] I'm talking about resisting, not grasping,
    not getting caught in hope and in fear, in good and in bad, but
    actually living completely. (40)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Whether it's smoking a cigarette or drinking a cup of tea or making
    your bed or washing the dishes--whatever it might be--it's ritual in
    the sense of doing it properly, if you can hold the sadness in your
    heart as well as the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. (78)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    We can stop thinking that good practice is when it's smooth and
    calm, and bad practice is when it's rough and dark. If we can hold
    it all in our hearts, then we can make a proper cup of tea. (81)
    [Tiger: don't prefer one over the other. They exist in a balance.]
