## Notes

* Nina Jacobson is a force in Hollywood. Sheâ€™s behind some of the biggest movies
of the last 20 years: The Sixth Sense, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Chronicles
of Narnia, The Hunger Games, and most recently Crazy Rich Asians.
* If you don't think your employee is better than you, you've hired the wrong
person
* It's better to make something a few people love than something lots of people
merely like
* You will fail
