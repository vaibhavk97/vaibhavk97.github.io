## Notes

* **Senior engineers reduce risk**: technical risk, product risk
* Startups fail because they build the wrong product. Senior engineers
  speed up the search for the right product, or narrow the search space.
* After product-market fit: breaking up teams, breaking up code, scaling
  * All things that affect the larger system
* Senior engineers find leverage
* Senior engineers are storytellers. Good at explaining stuff! Essential
  skill.
