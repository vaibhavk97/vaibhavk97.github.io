summary: "How modern pop music became the way it is today. Rihanna, Kelly
Clarkson, etc. Turns out I'm not actually that interested in the music industry."

*TL;DR*: Modern music, tracing its origins to Swedish beatmakers in the 1980s,
is all made according to the same formulas that will please peoples' ears after
it's been drilled into their head over and over.

## Notes/Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Specialized teams of songwriter-producers employ a method of composition I
    call track-and-hook to make songs that are almost irresistable. Record
    labels have figured out how to orchestrate demand for top artists like katy
    Perry and Rihanna, relying on their close alliance and long history with
    commercial radio. And the public, given the ability to call up any song they
    choose, still wants to listen to what everyone else is playing. (26)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    As Denniz once said, in response to a question about how hard could it
    possibly be to write such simple songs, "it's much more difficult to make it
    simple, especially achieving a simplicity without having it sound incredibly
    trivial" (49) [Tiger: you see this theme of "simplicity is difficult"
    everywhere! Drilled into you in software development.]
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Denniz died  on August 30, 1998 [...] He was buried in Solna; his gravestone
    is shaped like an eighth note--a symbol he had no use for because he never
    learned to read music. (119)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The music business slowly changed from an art-house business run by men with
    ears into a corporate enterprise of quarterly earnings and timely results.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Guy Zapoleon observed that popular music fads seem to move in a three-part
    cycle. Over time, he formulated a set of laws that, he believes, drives the
    pop cycle. It starts in the middle, with "pure pop" [...] But pure pop eras
    inevitably give way to what Zapoleon calls "the doldrums," when Top 40
    becomes bland and boring, and ratings decline. In response, program
    directors row away from pure pop, toward the more perilous waters Zapoleon
    calls "the extremes," in order to restore excitement to their stations. The
    extremes--alt-rock and hip-hop--attract younger listeners [...] but repel
    older ones, and so program directors begin rowing back toward the pure-pop
    mainstream, and the cycle starts again. (150)

    Henceforth [Lee Soo-Man's] stars would be made, not born, using a
    sophisticated system of artistic development. Lee took Lou Pearlman's idea
    of putting together different personality types in a singing group and made
    a musical Samsung out of it, employing a method of cultural production Lee
    called "cultural technology". (187)
