## Notes

* Invest in predictions
* Unique data compounded ML
* Pre product stage
* How to compete with Google? Pick a good market. Apply vertically
* What to look for: uniqueness, fungibility, dimensionality, perishability
(contact info doesn't really perish)
* Job: go through every market. Find out what the status quo is. Build a smarter
version.
* The most important thing by Mark something
* Always go where others aren't
* Kindest thing you can do is let people be what they want to be. Got final exam
  2yrs early and got 2 years of self study
