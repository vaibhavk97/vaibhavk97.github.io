## Notes

* A manager should act as a **buffer** for his/her team.
* A manager should be **optimistic**.
* Priorities: company first, team second, individual third.
* Must be able to context switch quickly
* Say no.
* Stay out of the critical path when coding. You don't have as much
  context as your tea,.

* **"As a CTO, my default loop is 'First, cycle through all my employees and
  make sure that I have equipped them to be happy and productive in their
  jobs. Second, find something to do. If possible, delegate it; if not, do
  it. Repeat.'"**
