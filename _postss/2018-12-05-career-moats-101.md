## Notes

* A career moat is an individualâ€™s ability to maintain competitive advantages
  over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long
  term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient
  financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval
  castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches
  from outsiders.
