## Notes

* All great people got out of their comfort zone. They also got knocked down and
got back up
* Why is your best friend your best friend?
* Curiosity is the best trait. Sad that curiosity gets stifled starting in

* Stories must include vulnerability. Without kryptonite there is no Superman
