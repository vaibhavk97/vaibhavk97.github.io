summary: "Mostly common sense advice on how to navigate social situations. Honestly reassured me about my own social skills more than anything else."
---

*TL;DR*: Grab bag of tips, advice, walkthroughs on how to navigate
social interactions and make friends. I was looking for a deeper level
of content on the human psyche, but this was mostly common sense.

## Notes

* I guess my social skills are better than I thought? This book is more
  for those whose lack of social skills severely affects their lives, or
  maybe even lie on the autism spectrum. Most of the advice is pretty
  common sense to me, which I suppose is a good thing.
* For the things I did struggle with, it was nice to see them put into
  words. The author does a good job of presenting things simply and
  nonjudgmentally.
* Didn't get into deeper stuff (negotiations, etc.) that I hoped it
  would
* Get over counterproductive thoughts:
  * Step 1: **Identify** your counterproductive thoughts and beliefs.
  * Step 2: Critically **examine** your counterproductive thoughts and
    beliefs.
  * Step 3: Come up with more realistic, balanced **alternatives** for your
    counterproductive thoughts and beliefs.
  * Step 4: Continually **question** your counterproductive thoughts and
    beliefs.
* Goals for initial conversation:
  * Goal 1: have an interaction that's **rewarding** for everyone involved
  * Goal 2: **Learn** about the other person and try to find common ground
  * Goal 3: **Share** things about yourself with the other person
* Ending conversations:
  * Wrap it up without any window dressing: "I gotta run. Good talking
    to you."
  * "Anyway, I'll let you get back to it..."
  * Use a reason for why you have to leave the conversation
* Forming relationships, a formula:
  * Find some potential friends
  * Make plans with those potential friends to hang out
  * Once you have some budding friendships, gradually take those
    relationships to a deeper level
  * Repeat the above steps until you've made as many friends as you'd
    like

    Disqualifying the positive is when you dismiss positive events for
    no real reason, probably while being all too eager to accept the
    negative ones. (54)

    People often respect someone who has the guts to go for what they
    want, even if they're rejected. (65)

    You'll never stop having undesirable thoughts, but with practice you
    can get better at not reacting to them. (70)

    The most effective way to face a fear is to gradually expose
    yourself to it; this is called exposure therapy. (87)

<blockquote>

    People tend to see attractive, put-together individuals as having
    more appealing personalities. It's a mental bias called the **halo
    effect**. (240)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    State what you want, and then keep repeating it if they argue
    against you. It won't guarantee they'll give you what you're asking
    for because there's no way to perfectly control other people, but
    at least from your end, you won't let yourself get pulled off
    course. (263)
