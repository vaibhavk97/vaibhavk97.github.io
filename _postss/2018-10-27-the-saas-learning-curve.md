## Notes

* Innovators represent about 10% of the market and will provide you with great
  product feedback but rarely have a budget. As such, they are quite useful in
  the pre-revenue stage of a Service as a Software company.
* Early Adopters represent another 10â€“15% of the market and they have a budget.
  They often buy because they seek a competitive advantage. They see that being
  achieved by working with you to realize what should become a shared vision for
  your product.
* Start thinking of SaaS as Service as a Software, not Software as a Service.
