## Notes

* Every founder has to shape culture from day one. The culture you start
  with is the culture you will keep
* How to scale human interaction?
  * Online community, not social media
* Total addressable market is ginormous in a networked world. Take the
  gourmet local chocolate shop but expand the market globally
* Standing against something gives you a strong sense of identity
