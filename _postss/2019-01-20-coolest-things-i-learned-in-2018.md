## Notes

* Whenever there is a market fad/phenomena with low or no barriers and a flood
 of entrantsâ€”the best strategy is often: Be the arms dealer.
 * The lowest profile players in high-profile, low-barrier industries are
   almost always the most profitable.
 * Don't sell wine, sell barrels.
 * Don't make movies, create animation software.
 * Don't own restaurants, build the restaurant supply company.
* Feynman: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation
  that makes it obvious.
* "Avoid boring people" - Jim Watson, co-discoverer of DNA
* A Simple Formula for Writing Better Hooks
  * "Get 3 yes's in 30 seconds."
  * Readers should nod their head yes to the headline, subheading, and first
  sentence.
  * If they've made it to the third sentence, they're ready for an interesting and
    compelling story.
