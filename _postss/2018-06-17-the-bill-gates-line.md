summary: "The distinction between platforms and aggregators is important! Platforms are a much better model."

## Notes

* _This isn't a platform. A **platform is when the economic  value of
  everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates
  it.**_
  * _This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms
    and aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a
    relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; aggregators,
    on the other hand, intermediate and control it._
  * _The best strategies entail business models that avoid Google and
    Facebook completely: look no further than Amazon, which last month
    stopped buying Google Shopping ads, something the company can afford
    to do given that half of shoppers start their product searches on
    Amazon._
