## Notes

* Deep presence = dominance. Be there in the moment. No roles, no agenda.
* Getting your solitary time allows you to be more present in groups
* Human capital >>>>>>> financial capital
* Visit Boyd and Bronwyn Varty
* Deep curiosity: exploration and strange intersections. Combine experience and
interest
* Persistence through randomness
* Risk management: good stuff is in new places
* Trail magic: kindness and goodwill from strangers. So positive sum.
* Follow your own way always
