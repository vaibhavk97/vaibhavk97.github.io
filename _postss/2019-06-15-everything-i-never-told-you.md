*TL;DR*: Lydia Lee, a 16 year old in Middletown, commits suicide. Her family
grapples with how this could have happened. It turns out everyone, including
Lydia, has their own internal demons that don't come out until it's too late.
Then they are left to figure out how they can be better in the future.

## Response

Extremely relatable as a Chinese-American myself. Execution was just missing a
little bit of something though. Paints a vivid picture of how death, and
especially suicide, affects everyone who was close to the deceased. Shows how it
can tear people apart, but also slightly optimistically how it can help people
improve on their own flaws. Wish I could have been slightly more invested in the
characters, but don't have a concrete suggestion for how that could have
happened -- maybe not as many time jumps? Mabye a little more "show, don't tell"
w.r.t. their emotions?

* Next time: Ankify responses? Feelings? idk

## Plot

* Takes place in 1977 in suburban Ohio
* Lydia Lee is dead. At first, they think she just ran away, but she's found in
  the lake a few days after going missing
* Jumps back to 1955. Marilyn and James (Lydia's parents) meet at Harvard where
  she is a student at the women's college and he is a graduate student teachinga
  class. They fall in love
  * Odd match. Marilyn is from Virginia and her mother is extremely
    traditional, while she wants to be a doctor and is willing to endure lots of
    doubt and sexism to make it happen. James is the son of Chinese immigrants
    and has felt like an outcast his whole life because of this.
* Marilyn gets pregnant, so they get married and she drops out of school.
  Marilyn's mother disapproves, and they never see each other again
* Jack Wolff is introduced -- a student at Lydia's school who she spent a lot of
  time with leading up to her death.. Lydia's older brother Nath thinks he knows
  something about why Lydia killed herself.
* Stressed out, James sleeps with his teaching assistant Louisa, who is also
  Chinese. He finds comfort in her familiarity
* Time skip back 11 years to when Lydia is 5. Marilyn's mother dies, and going
  through her mother's old stuff and realizing how sad her life was prompts
  Marilyn to want to pursue her own dreams again, which unfortunately means
  leaving her family behind. She drops everything and enrolls in school
* 3 weeks later, she finds out she's pregnant, so she returns home to her kids
  * During this time, Lydia vows to never disappoint her mother again, so that
    her mother never leaves again. At the same time, Marilyn vows that Lydia
    will be a doctor, pushing her own dreams onto her daughter
* James and Marilyn both favor Lydia, and this frustrates Nath. He gets into
  Harvard though, and cannot wait to go to college.
* Lydia befriends Jack in the last semester before her death. Jack has a
  reputation as a player, but their relationship is purely platonic and they
  find that they have a lot in common. Lydia opens up to Jack about her
  frustration with the pressure from her parents. Lydia is failing physics and
  does not feel like she can keep up.
* Back in the present, after Lydia's death, Marilyn finds out that James is
  sleeping with Louisa and confronts both of them
* Hannah notices Lydia is distraught in the weeks leading up to her death, but
  does not bring it up. All Hannah wants is to be noticed. She is used to being
  the fly on the wall, ignored.
* Time-skip to the days before Lydia dies. Various events push her to the
  breaking point, including being ignored by her older brother and jack
  rejecting her sexual advances. She decides to jump into the lake even though
  she cannot swim.
* Back after her death, James and Marilyn make up. Nath and Hannah also come to
  terms with everything. Everyone resolves to move forward with sadness, but
  also to honor Lydia's memory by not making the same mistakes again.

## Characters

* Lydia Lee: girl who commits suicides and prompts the entire story. Feels
  completely weighed down by the pressure from her family, wants to be her own
  person but lacks the facilities to express that
* Marilyn Lee: Lydia's mom. Her whole life she has wanted to escape the "perfect
  housewife" life that her mother led and wanted for her. When she finds that
  she has fallen into it anyways, she decided that her daughter will be a
  doctor. Puts a ton of pressure on Lydia, often doesn't pay as much attention
  to her other kids.
* James Lee: Lydia's father. Son of Chinese immigrants, and this shapes his
  life. Has always felt like an outcast. Wants his son to be different, but also
  feels ashamed that he is not strong enough himself. Experience of racism leads
  him to become isolated
* Nathan Lee: Lydia's older brother. Has always been mildly jealous of the
  attention she gets, but is there for her nonetheless. Is looking forward to
  being able to go to Harvard and escape his family, and that makes him neglect
  his family a bit.
* Hannah Lee: Lydia's younger sister. Has always been extremely quiet, and feels
  ignored by her family. Is very empathetic and observant of those around her.
* Jack Wolff: boy who lives on the same street as the Lees. Has a reputation as
  a player at school. Becomes friends with Lydia in the months leading up to her
  death. Is secretly gay/bisexual for Lydia's brother Nath. When he rejects
  Lydia's sexual advances, it's one of the things that pushes Lydia over the
  edge to suicide.

## Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (Referring to Lydia's motivation for suicide) Because more than anything, her
  mother had wanted to stand out; because more than anything, her father had
  wanted to blend in. Because those things had been impossible. (25)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (Marilyn) She thought of her mother, the life her mother had wanted for her,
  the life her mother had hoped to lead herself: husband, children, house, her
  sole job to keep it all in order. Without meaning to, she’d acquired it. (78)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (Lydia, after her mother comes home from her disappearance) If her mother ever
  came home and told her to finish her milk, she thought, the page wavering to a
  blur, she would finish her milk. She would brush her teeth without being asked
  and stop crying when the doctor gave her shots. She would go to sleep the
  second her mother turned out the light. She would never get sick again. She
  would do everything her mother told her. Everything her mother wanted. (137)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  For her it was too late. But it wasn’t too late for Lydia. Marilyn would not
  be like her own mother, shunting her daughter toward husband and house, a life
  spent safely behind a deadbolt. She would help Lydia do everything she was
  capable of. She would spend the rest of her years guiding Lydia, sheltering
  her, the way you tended a prize rose: helping it grow, propping it with
  stakes, arching each stem toward perfection. In Marilyn’s belly, Hannah began
  to fidget and kick, but her mother could not yet feel it. She buried her nose
  in Lydia’s hair and made silent promises. Never to tell her to sit up
  straight, to find a husband, to keep a house. Never to suggest that there were
  jobs or lives or worlds not meant for her; never to let her hear doctor and
  think only man. To encourage her, for the rest of her life, to do more than
  her mother had. (146)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (James, to Nath) He did not understand why he said these things to Nath, for
  that would have meant understanding something far more painful: that Nath
  reminded him more and more of himself, of everything he wanted to forget from
  his own boyhood. (154)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (Marilyn) Everything that she had wanted for Lydia, which Lydia had never
  wanted but had embraced anyway. A dull chill creeps over her. Perhaps—and this
  thought chokes her—that had dragged Lydia underwater at last. (244)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  (James) What made something precious? Losing it and finding it. All those
  times he’d pretended to lose her. (279)
