## Notes

* CRISPR: **Gene editing**
  * Pioneer: Jennifer Doudna
  * **Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats**
* Genetic vaccination card. Cells store DNA of viruses from past to help
  if it reappears in future
* CAS9 programmable protein. Works like scissors
* CRISPR on animals: China mosquitoes. Micro pigs
* Very scary. Must be cautious
* **Somatic changes**: tissue changes in fully developed person. Not
  heritable
* **Germ line changes**: changes to eggs, embryos, sperm. Passed on.
