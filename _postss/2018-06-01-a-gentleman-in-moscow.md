*TL;DR*: Count Alexander Rostov, a "former person", is sentenced to
house arrest for life in the Hotel Metropol in Russia. He is a man of
culture and makes his experience of decades locked in a hotel quite
uniquely colorful (though not without its low points).

## Notes

* The inner monologue of the Count is incrediblly rich. I think
subconsciously I have tried to adopt parts of it, more likely than not
for the better.
* _Tons_ of snippets incoming, I loved the writing in this book.

    It demanded to be written. I simply happened to be sitting at the
    particular desk on the particular morning when it chose to make its
    demands (4)

    The Count said this with the renowned glint in his eye--that little
    spark that had defused heated conversations and caught the eyes of
    beauties in every salon in St. Petersburg. (42)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    With so little to do and all the time in the world to do it, the
    Count's peace of mind continued to be threatened by a sense of
    <b>ennui</b>--that dreaded mire of the human emotions. (54)

    If a room that exists under the governance, authority, and intent of
    others seems smaller than it is, then a room that exists in secret
    can, regardless of its dimensions, seem as vast as one cares to
    imagine. (64) [Tiger: this goes for spaces in general. Love it.]

    "<b>It is the business of the times to change</b>, Mr. Halecki. And it is
    the business of gentlemen to change with them. [...] For the times
    do, in fact, change. They change relentlessly. Inevitably.
    Inventively. And as they change, they sset into bright relief not
    only outmoded honorifics and hunting horns, but silver summoners and
    mother-of-pearl opera glasses and all manner of carefully crafted
    things that have outlived their usefulness. (75)

    Systematic in all matters of importance, Nina ate her ice cream one
    flavor at a time, moving from the lightest to the darkest in shade.
    Thus, having already dispatched her French vanilla, she was now
    moving on to a scoop of lemon, which perfectly matched her dress.

    A careful accounting of days allows the isolated to note that
    another year of hardship has been endured; survived; bested. Whether
    they have found the strength to persevere through a tireless
    determination or some foolhardy optimism, those 365 hatch marks
    stand as proof of their indomitability. For after all, <b>if
    attentiveness should be measured in minutes and discipline measured
    in hours, then indomitability must be measured in years [...]
    attaning of the upper hand on the field of battle is measured in the
    instant.</b> (109)

    first instinct is to disagree, but I think the key is the second
    part. I have a pretty high bar for "devotion"]

    The <b>Confederacy of the Humbled</b> is a close-knit brotherhood whose
    members travel with no outward markings, but who know each other at
    a glance. For having fallen suddenly from grace, those in the
    Confederacy share a certain perspective. Knowing beauty, influence,
    fame, and privilege to be borrowed rather than bestowed, they are
    not easily impressed. They are not quick to envy or take offense.
    They certainly do not scour the papers in search of their own names.
    They remain committed to living among their peers, but they greet
    adulation with caution, ambition with sympathy, and condescension
    with an inward smile. (196)

    The Count's father believed that while a man should attend closely
    to life, he should not attend too closely to the clock. [...] If a
    man woke no later than six, engaged in a light repast, and then
    applied himself without interruption, by the hour of noon he should
    have accomplished a full day's labor. (244)

    For all the varied concerns attendant to the raising of a
    child--over schoolwork, dress, and manners--in the end, <b>a parent's

    into adulthood so that she could have a chance to experience a life
    of purpose and, God willing, contentment. (309)

    When all was said and done, <b>the endeavors that most modern men saw

    their immediate attention.</b> (391)
