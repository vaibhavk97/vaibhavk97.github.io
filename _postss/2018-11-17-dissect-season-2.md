## Notes

Listening to Dissect was truly life-changing.

Because it is such an intensely and uniquely auditory experience, I feel like I
cannot do it justice with a summary. Additionally, it is the rare piece of
striking content which has such an effect that I don't feel the need to record
notes in order to remember it. Every time I hear a song from this album, or when
I am struck to listen to it all the way through on my own, Cole Cuchna's voice
plays as an accompanying track in the back of my head.

Lost in the depth and beauty of the albums he is analyzing, I want to make sure
I acknowledge that Cole's thoroughness and enthusiasm shines through and is a
work of art in itself.

Season 2 takes us through Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, his
comeback album after the infamous VMA event where he interrupted Taylor Swift.
Learning about the backstory for Kanye's music career and for the creation of
this album in particular gave me a deep, deep appreciation and kinship with
Kanye and his craft.

Seriously, listen to this podcast.
