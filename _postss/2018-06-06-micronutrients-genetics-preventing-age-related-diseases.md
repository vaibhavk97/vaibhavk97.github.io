## Notes

* Guest: Dr Rhonda Patrick
* Vitamins and minerals we need
  * **Recommended daily allowance is bare minimum**
  * Magnesium prevents cancer mutations
  * Folate for cell reproduction. Leafy greens
* Nutrogenomics: your ancestors' diet can dictate how your body responds
  to stuff
  * Can test online
* Intermittent fasting is really good. Forces damaged cells to commit
  apoptosis. Like taking out laundry
