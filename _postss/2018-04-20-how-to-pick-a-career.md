summary: "Conventional wisdom sucks. Reason from first principles to pick a career for yourself."
---

*TL;DR*: Conventional wisdom sucks. Reason from first principles to pick
a career for yourself.

## Notes

* "Typical" life path sucks. Everyone floats down the "river" with the
  same macro guidance, and then get spit out into the real world which
  is completely different.
* It's worth thinking about this stuff: a typical career will take up
  somewhere **between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult life**
* Options = intersection of yearnings (what you want) and reality (what
  is possible)

### Yearnings: What You Want

* Everyone has a personal yearnings octopus with all of their
  conflicting thoughts and feelings
  * **Personal** tentacle: why billionaires don't just retire and do nothing
  * **Social** tentacle: obsessed with what people think of you
  * **Lifestyle** tentacle: just wants pleasure and relaxation
  * **Moral** tentacle: what kind of impact can I make?
  * **Practical** tentacle: oh shoot I have to pay rent
  * **Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise**

* Dissecting yearnings: "Why? Why? Why?"...leads to a "Because"
* Interrogate your yearnings to see if they are truly yours.
  * Do you treat the words of your external influences as information,
    held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you've carefully
    decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in
    your brain, _masquerading_ as the inner you?
* Prioritize your yearnings
  * You are what you do. Your priorities are easily observable through
    your actions.

* As you prioritize, remember **you are the only wise one in the room**.
  You are the only one with the full picture.

### Reality: What Is Possible

* Yearnings help you figure out what you want. **What you think you want
  is what you are in the _habit_ of wanting, not what you truly deep down
  want**.
* Beliefs that dictate career possibilities:
  * Beliefs about the world
    * _Today's world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which
      usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we're
      wired for an ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so
      we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as
      equivalent to truth_
    * Think critically about all of the possibilities! They are way more
      numerous than conventional wisdom would have you think.
  * Beliefs about your own potential
    * _With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to
      potentially reach wherever your definition of success in that
      career?_
      * **Progress = Pace * Persistence**
        * Pace: level of chefness, work ethic, natural ability
        * Persistence: how much time you are willing to commit to
          chasing
    * _Conventional wisdom doesn't get how non-traditional careers work
      -- it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of successs: talent
      and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more
      going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls
      it "luck"._
    * Don't think of strengths and weaknesses as snapshots of individual
      skills (e.g. dribbling a basketball). Rather, think of them as
      important signaling traits (stubbornness, work ethic).
      * Think in terms of _potential for improvement_
        * Ex: if you gave Michael Jordan a basketball at 25 for the first
          time, it would be wrong to call basketball a weakness under
          this framework
* Take all these factors to build your reality box

### Connecting the Dots

* Your career is a series of dots. Connect those dots.
* How do I know if I should move?
  * Ask yourself truly deep down what doubts you have.
* Goal: not happiness, but **contentment**: feel like you're currently
  taking the best crack you can at a good life path.
* Summary of post:

* Final thoughts:
  * _It's when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming
    overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It's
    exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up
    losing our way._
  * _The mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because
    someone else tookt he wheel of my head and overruled the quited,
    insecure voice of my authentic self -- the mistakes that I knew at
    the time, deep down, were wrong._

## Thoughts

* Drier than most WBW posts but still engaging and of course informative
* Always seems to put into words things I've thought for a long time.
  Nice.
* Did not trigger as much existential dread about my own career choices
  as I thought it would. Still quite happy about software
  development/entrepreneurship/machine learning as things I work hard at
  and enjoy.
