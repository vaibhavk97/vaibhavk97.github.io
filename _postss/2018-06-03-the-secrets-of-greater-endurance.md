## Notes

* Endurance determinants: VO2 max (how much oxygen you can breathe in, max
  aerobic quantity). "Human machine" model
* **We aren't buckets we are balloons**
* Central governance. Brain stops muscles so you stay alive
* Important concept: **rate of perceived effort**. i.e. if it's an 8 on
  your set than maybe you can do 2 more reps
* Lots of conflicting research on keto/paleo, hydration. Hard to say at
  this point
* Can train **response inhibition** to increase indurance. Basically,
  tell brain to shut the fuck up.
