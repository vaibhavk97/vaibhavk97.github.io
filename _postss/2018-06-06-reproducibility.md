## Notes

* Guest: Clare Gollnick has neuro background
* **P hacking**: reanalyzing data to try and find an explanation. Icky
* All data is from the past. Assumption that it's predictive is faulty
* Better model is "I looked at it differently" instead of "I tried a ton
  of stuff and one happened to work"
