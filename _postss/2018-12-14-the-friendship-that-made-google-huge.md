## Notes

* The problem was that, as Google grew, its computing infrastructure also
  expanded. Computer hardware rarely failed, until you had enough of it—then it
  failed all the time. Wires wore down, hard drives fell apart, motherboards
  overheated. Many machines never worked in the first place; some would
  unaccountably grow slower. Strange environmental factors came into play.
  * Solved by MapReduce
* Jeff once circulated a list of “Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should
  Know.” In fact, it’s a list of numbers that almost no programmer knows: that
  an L1 cache reference usually takes half a nanosecond, or that reading one
  megabyte sequentially from memory takes two hundred and fifty microseconds.
  These numbers are hardwired into Jeff’s and Sanjay’s brains.
