## Notes

* Argue that sugar should be regulated, like alcohol and tobacco, on the grounds
that itâ€™s addictive and toxic.
* Acute health crises get all the attention, but diet and nutrition and exercise
are more important
* Americans consume 30 tsp of added sugar a day
* Criteria for drugs:
* Ubiquity
* Toxicity
* Potential for abuse
* Externalities
* Pessimistic meta-induction: why should we do anything if it will always end up
  being wrong in 10 years?
