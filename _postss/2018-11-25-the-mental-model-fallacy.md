## Notes

* The mental model fallacy is that it’s worth it to read descriptions of mental
  models, written and aggregated by non-practitioners, in the pursuit of
  self-improvement and success.
* The second half of this assertion is false: you cannot learn the mental models
  that are responsible for success through reading and thinking. The reason for
  this is the same reason that attempting to learn how to ride a bicycle by
  reading a book is stupid. The most valuable mental models do not survive
  codification. They cannot be expressed through words alone.
* The answer is that the mental models that make Buffett and Munger so effective
  are divided into two types: mental models that are explicit knowledge and
  mental models that are tacit knowledge.
* Similarly, the idea that knowledge can be divided into explicit and tacit is
  not new: the Ancient Greeks called the former epistêmê and the latter technê,
  loosely translated into ‘knowledge’ and ‘art’.
* Read from the source material of master practitioners, copy their actions,
  climb their skill trees,  and reflect through trial and error. Don't read
  third-party accounts of technê. And stop reading this blog if my career goals
  diverge from yours.
