## Notes

* Origin in Japanese jiu jitsu
* Why jiu jitsu?
* It's more reliable. Technical leverage, distance management
* You're not gonna punch me, I'm gonna grab you. I'm not gonna agree to stand in
front of you and punch
* Everyone is the same height on the ground
* We have 4 limbs, they have 2
* More applicable and practical than judo
* Self defense isn't winning fight, it's knowing how to avoid fight
