## Notes

* Characteristics of people with "Chinese businessman wisdom": thrifty, low-key,
  savvy, cunning, pragmatic, and respected — even begrudgingly! — by the
  communities they run businesses in.
* The following paradox: first, that the most successful Chinese businessmen
  were often the least educated ones. Second, that Chinese businessmen as a
  group were more superstitious than most, but that this didn’t seem to have
  much of an effect on their ability to run their businesses! And finally, that
  the vast majority of Chinese businesspeople did not think too far ahead. They
  optimised locally, and by keeping close tabs on the bottom line, shut down
  lines of business that weren’t performing as well.
