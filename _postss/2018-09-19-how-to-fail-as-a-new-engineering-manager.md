## Notes

* Stop coding. Instead focus on code reviews etc.
* Focus on the people and the work
* Measure your value by the impact you have on others' output, not on your own
  output
* Express your expectations: assumptions and expectations when delegating work
* Communicate commitments/deadlines clearly to the team
* Lead, don't direct. Leadership inspires, it doesn't dictate.
* Lean in to hard conversations
  * Address issues quickly
  * Be specific, have examples
  * Focus on behavior, not on the person themself
* Keep learning your craft
