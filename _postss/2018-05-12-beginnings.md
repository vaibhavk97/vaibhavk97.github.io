## Notes

* A new beginning is one of many new beginnings. Happens all the time!
* You don't need a landmark (first of month, etc) to make a new
  beginning
* Health reaches out and touches every other part of your life
* Routine is should. Habit is must.
* Starting over: taking massive action in line with your values and
  beliefs
* Comfort is the place where you grow and learn the least
* Uncertainty is not risk. if you've put a ton of work in, there may be
  uncertainty, but little risk. If you speak to 100 people, it's
  uncertain which 40 will be impacted, but there is very little risk
  that no one will be impacted.
