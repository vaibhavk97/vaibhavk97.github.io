* Describing knowledge of a system probabilistically, having an appropriate
prior probability, know how to weigh new evidence, and following Bayes's rule to
compute the revised distribution.
* How Yoshi sends signals about her food preferences.
* Prob x given y
* Posterior probability and prior probability
* Distribution after and distribution before
* Prior times likelihood is posterior
* Converges quickly to new posterior
