summary: "How do you find things to work on? Find the duct tape and soften the edges. Requires talking to people!"

## Notes

* Go around and find out what kind of little one-off tools people have
  designed. Talk to them and hear their stories. Look in their personal
  bin directories. Take notes and look for patterns. See if anything
  stands out, or if anything particularly compelling grabs you during
  the interviews.
* Then, if you go off and build something new to soften a rough edge,
  not only do they get to remove the duct tape, but you have a bunch of
  interested users from day one. Also, just think of the goodwill that
  is bound to follow when they realize that finally, someone cares about
  the end-user experience, and is willing to adapt upstream to make
  their lives better.
