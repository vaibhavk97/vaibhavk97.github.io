## Notes

* Kate Leaver
* Modern society structure, technology make us think we have an enormous circle
of friends when we really need 5 good ones
* Any ailment physical or mental can be linked to or made worse by loneliness
* To make new friends, start by auditing your own life
* Loneliness is like a silent disco where you're the only one without headphones
on
* Female friendship has vulnerability
* Men respond to anxiety with fear and flight, women respond with tend and
befriend
* Internalized homophobia with male friendships
* Both sides need some parts of the other
* "Your flaws bring somewhere"
* Give yourself and others permission to be friends with the opposite sex
* Sardinia bunch of 100 year old people -- they have normal lives but they are
  always surrounded by friends and family
