## Notes

* Max Weber argued that Protestantism created wealth. Finally, there are data to
prove if he was right. All it took were some missionary experiments in the
Philippines and a clever map-matching trick that goes back to 16th-century
Germany.
* James Choi @ Yale
* Lots of suggested evidence but not much convincing
* 80% of the planet is religious
* Experiment in the Philippines
* Very poor people earned more money as a result of religious instruction
* Why? Optimism and grit
