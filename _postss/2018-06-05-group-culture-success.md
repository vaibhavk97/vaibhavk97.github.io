## Notes

* Guest: Daniel Coyle
* What leaders need to provide: **vision, purpose, connection**
* **Deep fun > shallow fun**. This is why people in great cultures are
  working hard and why people return to great cultures
* Good culture: spurs, seal team 6
* Bad culture: missile minute men
  * Fear, lack of future
* **Allen curve**: personal interaction boosts creativity and happiness
* Questions to ask during 1-on-1:
  * What should we keep doing
  * What should we stop doing
  * Tell me something I don't know
* **Vulnerability loops** are essential for good communication
  * Leaders should say "I screwed that up"
* Critic cannot suggest the change. **Owner should maintain ownership**
