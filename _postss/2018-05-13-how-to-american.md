*TL;DR*: Love this story. Would never have the balls to do some of the stuff he did. Super happy for his success chasing his dreams

## Notes

* Another example of how success doesn't happen overnight. Very few
  people would be willing to put in the work Jimmy did. Beast.
* Very wholesome. Loved the accounting of relationship with family,
  especially parents.
* Still a lot of areas Asian Americans have yet to break into.

## Snippets

    From being a child Ping-Pong star in Hong Kong, to coming to
    America and becoming a stand-up comedian, achieving his dream of
    being a strip club DJ only to discover how sad and depressing that
    is, to becoming a successful TV and movie actor, Jimmy has really
    experienced America like few have [...] He said that <b>this really is
    the land of opportunity, but most Americans just don't see it
    because they're simply too used to it</b>. They don't appreciate it and
    they don't take advantage of it as much as people who move here from
    other countries do. (VIII)

    In my Chinese family, my dad always tells me: "Pursuing your dreams
    is for losers. Doing what you love is how you become homeless." The
    most important values in Chinese culture are <b>family and
    obedience.</b>

  I figured it was <b>better to disappoint myself for a few years than to
    disappoint myself for the rest of my life.</b> (10)

    The study-abroad trip was such an amazing experience; it raised the
    bar for my standard of living. It made me not ever want to go back
    to my inadequate life back home. I felt a purposeful depression. <b>I
    wasn't sad; I was unsatisfied.</b> I wanted more out of life. I needed
    to step my life up. (80)

    I was pairing R&B songs with strippers like a sommelier at Spago
    suggesting which red goes best with the beef Bolognese. (120)

    It's exciting to chase after a new goal, but it's meaningless if you
    can't <b>sit down and enjoy the moment.</b> (203)
