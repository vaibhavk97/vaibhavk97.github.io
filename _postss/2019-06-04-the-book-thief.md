*TL;DR*: A German foster child named Liesel Meminger is The Book Thief. The
story of her experience during the war.

## Response

Maybe I'm just numbing to all of these WWII novels but I couldn't muster up as
much relation to these characters as the ones in The Nightingale and Beneath a
Scarlet Sky

## Plot

* Death is the narrator
* Liesel Meminger is going to live with a foster family, the Hubermanns
* Liesel's brother dies on the trip to Molching
* She settles into her new life with her foster father Hans (kind and gentle)
  and foster mother Rosa (potty-mouth but sweet at heart). Becomes friends with
  a kid named Rudy down the street
* Hans teaches Liesel to read. Liesel stole one book on her way to Molching,
  finds others as time goes along
* Rosa does laundry for the rich people in town. As war hits, everyone is
  negatively affected and she loses business
* The mayor's wife, Frau Herrmann, is friendly to Liesel and allows her to use
  the library
* A Jew named Max hides in the Hubermann basement
  * Max's dad saved Hans's life once, and Hans feels like he owes it to him to
    protect him
* Liesel and Max become friends. Bond over books.
  * The whole family has to work together to keep the secret. War rages.
* Nazis begin parading Jews through Molching as part of publicity efforts. Hans
  tries to help one of the Jews, and gets whipped by Nazis. The house is no
  longer safe, so Max must leave. Irony is that they never come check the house
* Hans gets sent to war. Rudy's dad also gets sent to war for not allowing the
  Nazis to take Rudy.
* Hans gets injured and gets sent home to recover
* Liesel anxiously thinks about whether or not Max got captured. In one parade
  through Molching, she sees him :(. She ends up telling Rudy about Max
* One night, while Liesel is in the basement editing her book, her
  neighborhood is bombed. Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and the rest of the neighbors are
  killed. When rescue workers pull Liesel out of the rubble, she finds Rudy’s
  corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away,
  she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Death, who has
  been watching, rescues the book. Liesel goes to live with the mayor and his
  wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Max returns to Molching
  and finds Liesel. They hug and cry together. Liesel eventually grows up and
  moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Death
  finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years
  before.

  Once, words had rendered Liesel useless, but now, when she sat on the floor,
  with the mayor’s wife at her husband’s desk, she felt an innate sense of

  sentence. (L1908)

  When the war was over and Hitler had delivered himself to my arms, Alex

  him. They spent many days together, often walking to Dachau after its
  liberation, only to be denied by the Americans. (L6282)
