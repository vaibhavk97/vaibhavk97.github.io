summary: "Exercise -> stronger synapses -> stronger memory, stronger brain actions"
---

## Notes

* The potency of our synapses depends to some degree on how we live our
  lives. Lack of sleep, alcohol, diet and other aspects of our
  lifestyles, especially stress, may dampen the flow of messages between
  brain cells, while practice fortifies it. Repeat an action and the
  signals between the cells maintaining the memory of that action can
  strengthen. That is learning.
* Researchers separated groups into active, exercising mice and
  sedentary mice. Then parts of each group were stressed. Then they
  looked at neurons and the unstressed runners had the strongest,
  busiest synapses. Notably, _the stressed runners had neurons that were
  as strong as the unstressed sedentary animals_
