## Notes

* Background:
  * Moved around a ton. 11 schools as a kid
  * Undergrad research on neural networks. Not enough compute
  * Joined Google in 1999
  * Worked on MapReduce. Reliably at scale
* Beginning of resurrection of neural networks around 2008
* Next 5 years (from 2018): automated machine learning. E.g. maximize
  throughput through intersections in cities. Should be universally
  available to all cities, not just those with deep learning specialists

* **Differential privacy** is a mathematical definition for the privacy loss
  that results to individuals when their private information is used in
  the creation of a data product.
