## Notes

* Naomi loses her husband and two sons. Ruth, one of her daughters-in-law, stays
  with her, and they return to Bethelehem together. Two widows have very little
  social capital in Israel, but one of Naomi's husband's relatives, Boaz, shows
  them kindness and allows Ruth to pick through the fields after his men have
  gone through them. Ruth eventually marries Boaz.

## Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Ruth said, "Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you!
  Where you go, I will go; Where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be
  my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will dieâ€”there will I be
  buried. May the Lord do thus and so to me, and more as well, if even death
  parts me from you!" When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she
  said no more to her. (NRSV 1:16-18) [Tiger: LOYALTY]
