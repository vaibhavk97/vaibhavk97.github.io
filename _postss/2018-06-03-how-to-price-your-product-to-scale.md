## Notes

* Figure out unit economics first unless you are in winner take all market
* Don't hyperfocus on UI when struggling. Design can't fix fundamental
  flaw
* Every entrepreneur needs a **theory of human behavior** that your product is
  based on. i.e. Zuckerburg: people want to connect with the people
  around them.
* People get **anchored** to your first price. They'll get piseed if you
  change it.
