## Notes

* Fortunately, good storytelling is a skill that can learned by anyone. Here to
teach us the art of storytelling is Matthew Dicks, a writer, five-time Moth
GrandSlam storytelling winner, and the author of the book Storyworthy: Engage,
Teach, Persuade, and Change Your Life through the Power of Storytelling. 
* Today on the show, Matthew walks us through the nuts and bolts of how to craft
a compelling story. We begin our conversation discussing ways to generate story
ideas, why good stories donâ€™t have to be about big moments, and why he
recommends a practice called "Homework for Life."
* Homework for life. Journal one moment a day that is story worthy
* Little moments are good because relatable
* Stories come from first, last, best, worst
* Know the ending
* 5 second moment of change
* Begin with the opposite
* Know the stakes
