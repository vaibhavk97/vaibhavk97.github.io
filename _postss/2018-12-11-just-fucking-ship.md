## Notes

* One of the most surprising solopreneurship lessons for me over the past couple
of months has been the idea that shipping is a skill.
* Setting a deadline and taking it seriously will force you to make significant
  progress.
* For a project, you should start from the completed product, and then work backwards, asking:
  * What’s the end result look like, exactly?
  * How many chapters/videos/features?
  * What is absolutely required, what’s nice to have?
  * How perfect does it have to be?
  * How long will each of these take?
  * What has to come first?
  * What do I need to prepare?
  * How long will that take?
  * What do I need to find out?
  * How long will that take?
  * How much, or how little, defines success? And who controls that?
* Be crispy: specific, vivid, detailed
* Track your progress
  * Visible progress is a fantastic motivator.
  * Emotional management — when it comes to the sense of forward motion! —
    really, really matters.
* Have everything ready and ‘mise en place’ before you start working.
* If it’s not necessary, just let it go.
* The answer to these ‘feelings’ is to ignore all of them, in the same way that
  you ignore rain, and choose not to let a rainy day affect your mood
  permanently.
* My main takeaway from the book — apart from the techniques I’ve summarised
  above, which are, you know, kinda the point of the book —  my main takeaway is
  that shipping needs to deal with emotions effectively.
