## Notes

* The GOAT himself: **Bill Benter**
* _When they won, there were satisfied smiles only. They were
  professionals; cheering and hooting were for rubes._
* _a statistical phenomenon called **gambler's ruin**. It holds that if
  a player with limited funds keeps betting against an opponent with
  unlimited funds (that is, a casino), he will eventually go broke, even
  if the game is fair. All lucky streaks come to an end, and losing runs
  are fatal._
* _In pursuit of mathematical perfection, he became convinced that
  horses raced differently according to temperature, and when he learned
  that British meteorologists kept an archive of Hong Kong weather data
  in southwest England, he traveled there by plane and rail. A bemused
  archivist led him to a dusty library basement, where Benter copied
  years of figures into his notebook. When he got back to Hong Kong, he
  entered the data into his computers--and found it had no effect
  whatsoever on race outcomes. Such was the scientific process._
* Wagered $1.6M on the Triple Trio. Won it (of course), left prize money
  to charity.
* Multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in lifetime winnings
