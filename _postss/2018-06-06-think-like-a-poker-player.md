## Notes

* Guest: Annie Duke. Former pro poker player, into cog sci, now speaks
  at companies about decisionmaking
* Life is poker not chess
* **Think of your opinions as decisions and decisions as bets**
* Try to **analyze decisions outside of outcomes**
* Leaders need to express uncertainty. They should also speak last in
  meeting.
* Reason towards decision accuracy instead of correctness
