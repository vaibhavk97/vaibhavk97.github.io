*TL;DR*: Mistborn is a great fantasy read. Incredible world-building. Really
enjoyed the magic aspect and the descriptions. Would recommend to fans of Harry
Potter-like stories. Only nitpick is that the main character (Vin) is a bit of
a Mary Sue.

## Notes

* Centered around the idea of "allomancy": burning metals internally to create
  effects like moving fast or being strong
  * Also feruchemy: allows you to store things like strength or vision or energy
    in metals, and wear them on your body
* Skaa are slaves, "nobles" are the people who own skaas. Only noble blood can
  produce allomancy
* The Lord Ruler is considered immortal and all-powerful. He is both an
  allomancer and feruchemist
* "Obligators" are bureaucrats who are the eyes and ears of the Lord Ruler
* "Inquisitors" are scary and super powerful allomancers with spikes in their
  eyes. Only 20 or so of them.
* Vin discovers that the Lord Ruler is an allomancer and feruchemist by burning
  the "Eleventh Metal". Then her and Marsh fight the Lord Ruler together. Vin is
  able to get his feruchemy jewelry off of him. He loses his power and they are
  able to kill him.
