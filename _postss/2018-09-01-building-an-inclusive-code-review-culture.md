## Notes

* More than a couple back and forths and the discussion should be taken offline
  and fleshed out in real time. This can be indicative of a PR that was not
  properly spec’d or scoped, but regardless of why a PR discussion has
  spiraled, it’s important to recognize that it has and solve it appropriately.
