## Notes

* Ng Teng Fong: Singaporean businessman who never went to school but has built
  largest real estate development company in Singapore
* There are two basic approaches to problem solving: trial and error, and theory
  and insight. It’s difficult to overstate how much we are driven towards theory
  and insight by the formal education we receive.
* The optimal strategy for learning in business is trial and error, because
  business changes too quickly for there to be immutable rules. Traditional
  Chinese businessmen are thus the product of trial and error. The children who
  run their parent’s businesses are themselves taught via this principle of
  learning.
* If someone makes a mistake, takes a hit — as Ng Teng Fong did — but remains in
  the game, what matters is what they learn from it.
* Successful Chinese businessmen are better because they are better at trial and
  error. They use less cycles to learn the right lessons.
* It works because it can be as thoughtful as the person who does 'thinking and
  insight'; it works because trial and error never lies. It lets reality become
  the teacher.
