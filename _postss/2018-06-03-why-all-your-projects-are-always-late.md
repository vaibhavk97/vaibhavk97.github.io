summary: "Projects, especially big ones, are always late. This is due to optimism bias, coordination neglect, the planning fallacy, and (in the case of government) planners not being around for consequences."

## Notes

* 2nd avenue subway is a grotesque example
* **Planning fallacy** (Kahneman Tversky): people underestimate amount of time
  a project will take even while knowing other data points
* **Optimism bias** is positive! Leads to happiness. Just need to be aware of
  it
  * Leads to imagining scenario where things go right and dismissing
    scenario where things go wrong
* **Coordination neglect**: underestimating overhead of coordination when
  adding ppl to group
* Procrastination stems from **poor impulse control**
* Avoid state of continuous partial attention
* Use **reference class forecasting**: ignore your project. Look at similar
  projects.
