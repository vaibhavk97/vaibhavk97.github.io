## Notes

* 1 billion RMB investment from Tencent in MiningLamp last year
* Why? Three 3's
  * First group: AI in the cloud
    * Big data keeps getting bigger everywhere
    * Value of data has increased
    * Smart sensors are improving scale and dimension of data. All
      thanks to improvements and centralization in computing!
  * Second group: dimensions in which AI can be applied
    * Fields with massive amounts of data
    * Obviously inelastic demand (demand will not change even if price
      rises. Demand is very high).
    * Current solutions are flawed
  * Third group: challenges
    * Volume of data is large and difficult to handle, data silos create
      bottlenecks
    * Development of AI is still in infancy. Limit to value creation
    * Perception of businesses and governments towards AI must change
      and grow warmer
* MiningLamp released **Xiaming**, a police AI.
  * Analyze crime maps and identify suspects and probabilities.
    Comparable ability to an experienced police officer.
  * **Cognitive AI** vs. "perception AI". It "thinks" and makes
    decisions instead of just perceiving the world. Bias towards
    neocortex (thinking, imagination, NLP, symbol processing)
    * Together, perception + cognition = human intelligence
    * Three steps for development and adoption:
      * Bring data online
      * Implement online analysis and mining based on data
      * Closed-loop solution with a steady flow of customer value
* "Still a long way to go"
