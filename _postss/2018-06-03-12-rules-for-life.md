## Notes

* Intrinsic meaning in life: balancing security and expanding boundaries
  at the same time. Unerring guide to proper action in the world
* Hierarchy is natural. Consider the lobster. Social relationships are
  hierarchical.
* Have good posture.
* **Hanlon's Razor**: never attribute to malice that which is adequately
  explained by stupidity.
* Sacrifice is awesome. Give up something in the present for the benefit
  of the future
* The real world: people want to help
