summary: "Coming-of-age story for Ada Sibelius, home-schooled her whole life by her eccentric father but forced to grow up when he comes down with Alzheimer's. Enjoyed it."
---

*TL;DR*: Ada is raised by her father David. He home-schools her and
brings her to his computer science lab in Boston. She is socially
underdeveloped but extremely smart at the young age of 12. However,
David's old age begins to affect his mind. As his friends try to get his
affairs in order, a lot of questions come up. Ada must figure things out
as she also adjusts to life in the "real" world. Good novel with a slow
build-up but a satisfyingly good conclusion.

## Notes

* Didn't have the word flair of some of the fiction I've been reading.
  Refreshingly straightforward though
* Hard for me to get in character as a 12-year-old girl, or I may have
  gotten more out of it
* Tech/nerd side of things was fun for me
  * Overall very optimistic about AI. Benevolent AI future
* How does family/upbringing affect you?

## Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "This must be the most important factor in your choice of a life
    partner," he told Ada. "Who will most patiently and enthusiastically
    support your ambitions?" (18) [Tiger: self-centered lol]
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    David was passionate about cooking -- to him it was a cousin of
    chemistry (23)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    They were her father's favorite books of all time, but she had
    adopted them as her own so fully that she was no longer certain what
    the truth was (25) [Tiger: wow, like WBW career post]
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    These quiet moments, this liminal space between wakefulness and
    sleep, lingering in her confusion, willing herself backward into her
    dreams. (76)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    We must be constant and vigilant in our war against entropy, David
    used to say frequently. Entropy always has the upper hand. (82)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>Only humans can hurt one another</b>, Ada thought; only humans falter
    and betray one another with a stunning, fearsome frequency. As
    David's family had done to him; as David had done to her. And Ada
    would do it, too. She would fail other people throughout her life,
    inevitably, even those she loved the best. (441)

## Summary (spoilers duh)

* So David is actually this guy Harold Canady who was in real danger as
  a gay person working for the government in the 60's, so he faked his
  death and took on the identity of his boyfriend David Sibelius (who
  was estranged from his own family). He moved to Boston and started the
  lab, had Ada via surrogate, and the rest is history.
