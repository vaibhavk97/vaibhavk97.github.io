## Notes

* One of my favorite technical bloggers, but this post was kinda meh
* Stages of software:
  * Your software just works. It's fine.
  * Omg anything can break at any time this is impossible.
    * Learn to be scared
  * Keeping your site up is possible
* Stuff that helped:
  * Work on a dashboard! Track metrics!
  * Move complicated database code to a separate service
  * Profile and fix unnecessarily slow code
* Learn cool stuff by doing ops!
* **The best software engineers are the ones who consistently value the
  impact and lifecycle of the code they ship, and value deployment and
  instrumentation and observability.**
