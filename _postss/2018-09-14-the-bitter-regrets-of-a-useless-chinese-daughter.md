summary: "Bitingly relatable narrative on the experience of an Asian American"

## Notes

* Bitingly relatable narrative on the experience of a 2nd generation Asian American
* “guanxi,” the network of connections and relationships that make China function.
* Before my mother’s illness, I spurned what I saw as an excess of pragmatism
  among Chinese people, who want to ensure that all of their efforts go toward
  something useful. College degrees, jobs, friendships, marriages — all these
  should be chosen practically. “Be wise, pick an able man. Love doesn’t feed
  you,” my people like to say. Looking back on my high school years, all my
  relatives tried to talk me, a top-ranking student, into majoring in science or
  finance in college. But I was stubborn enough to stay with my favorite
  subject, literature. Now I understand them. They knew very well that in life,
  things can easily fall apart, and that those degrees are a promise of a
  steady, good-paying job, and perhaps a ticket to freedom, too.
* My promise is useless. Even my decision-making is useless. Whether I choose to
  go back home and take care of her or stay in the United States and keep
  reaching for my dream, sooner or later, I will regret either choice. I will
  scold myself for not having enough courage to take the other path.
* Relentless questioning of self
* Asian-American culturally pushed to doctor/lawyer/engineer
* It can seem surface-level but it ends up having real consequences
