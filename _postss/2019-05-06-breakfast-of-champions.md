I was supposed to."

*TL;DR*: My first Vonnegut book. Definitely a ride. Not sure I 'got' everything
I was supposed to.

## Plot

One of Kurt Vonnegutâ€™s  most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout,
finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer named Dwayne Hoover is taking his
fiction as truth.

* Trout is invited to speak at a festival in Midland City, where Dwayne lives
* Dwayne is becoming more and more mentally unstable
* Dwayne reads a novel of Trout's that explains to Dwayne that he is the only
  thing in the universe with true free will
* Dwayne becomes unhinged and beats up a ton of people
* Vonnegut inserts himself into the book and talks to Trout, telling Trout that
  he (Vonnegut) is the Creator of the Universe. Trout takes this in stride.

Written in short snippets, separated by three dots. Uses simple language.

  Here was the core of the bad ideas which Trout gave Dwayne: Everybody on Earth
  was a robot, with one exception--Dwayne Hoover. (14)

  <p>
  As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and
  mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come
  suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for
  them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were
  doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the
  reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device
  for ending short stories and books.
  </p>

  <p>
  Why were so many Americans treated by their government as though their lives
  were as disposable as paper facial tissues? Because that was the way authors
  customarily treated bit-part players in their made-up tales.
  </p>

  <p>
  And so on.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of
  people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling.
  I would write about life. Every personw ould be exactly as important as any
  other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left
  out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead,
  which I think I have done. (215)
