## Notes

* After dropping out of a machine learning PhD at Stanford, Daniel Ziegler
needed to decide what to do next. Heâ€™d always enjoyed building stuff and wanted
to shape the development of AI, so he thought a research engineering position at
an org dedicated to aligning AI with human interests could be his best option.
* Catherine Olsson, who has also worked at OpenAI, and left her computational
neuroscience PhD to become a research engineer at Google Brain. She and Daniel
share this piece of advice for those curious about this career path: just dive
in. If you're trying to get good at something, just start doing that thing, and
figure out that way what's necessary to be able to do it well.
* Daniel emphasizes that the most important thing was to practice *exactly*
those things that he knew he needed to be able to do.
* Google brain and open AI
* 2 parts of AI system
* Giving correct objective
* Optimizing for objective robustly
* AI safety is general
