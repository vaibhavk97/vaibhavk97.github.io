## Notes

* Naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior â€” and
causing more deaths than it saves.
* Naloxone and narcan. Narcan is easy and accessible
* A moral hazard!! Nobody can agree on whether access to Lazarus drug is a net
positive or negative
* Does it save lives?? Or does it enable more people to feel "safe" taking
drugs? Hard to say

  and Crime, by Jennifer L. Doleac and Anita Mukherjee
