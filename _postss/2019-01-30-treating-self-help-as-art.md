## Notes

* We have a bias to sit and talk, instead of to shut up and do. The latter is
not less thoughtful than the former, but we’ve been trained to think it is. If
it’s cheap to test an idea or technique, then it’s more costly to spend time
arguing than it is to test the thing. Thoughtfulness can come while doing.
* Developing Technique in the Wild is Better Than Reading Self Help
* What are action handles? I call action handles levers that you may manipulate
  to achieve a desired result.
