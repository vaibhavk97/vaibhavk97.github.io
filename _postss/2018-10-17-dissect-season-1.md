## Notes

Listening to Dissect was truly life-changing.

Because it is such an intensely and uniquely auditory experience, I feel like I
cannot do it justice with a summary. Additionally, it is the rare piece of
striking content which has such an effect that I don't feel the need to record
notes in order to remember it. Every time I hear a song from this album, or when
I am struck to listen to it all the way through on my own, Cole Cuchna's voice
plays as an accompanying track in the back of my head.

Lost in the depth and beauty of the albums he is analyzing, I want to make sure
I acknowledge that Cole's thoroughness and enthusiasm shines through and is a
work of art in itself.

Season 1 takes us through Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly, an
award-winning album that cemented my favorite rapper in the pantheon following
good kid, maad city.

Seriously, listen to this podcast.
