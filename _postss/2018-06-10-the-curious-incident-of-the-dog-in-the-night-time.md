*TL;DR*: Good-not-great story, a little bit gimmicky, maybe I related to him even a little bit with some of the obsessive thinking?

## Snippets

* Everything is super literal, since that's how Christopher perceives
  the world.

    thinking about them. (12)

    I think people believe in heaven because they don't like the idea of
    dying, because they want to carry on living and they don't like the

    things into the rubbish. (33)

    This shows that intuition can sometimes get things wrong. And
    intuition is what people use in life to make decisions. But logic
    can help you work out the right answer. (65)

    going to happen tomorrow or next year, or what might have happened
    instead of what did happen, and if it is a happy picture they smile
    and if it is a sad picture they cry. (119)

    special kind of accident. And for this accident to happen in this
    special way, there have to be <b>3 conditions. And these are 1) Things
    have to make copies of themselves (this is called Replication), 2)
    They have to make small mistakes when they do this (this is called
    Mutation), 3) These mistakes have to be the same in their copies
    (this is called Heritability)</b> (164)

## Summary

* Christopher is autistic/Asperger's and the story is told from his
  point of view. This takes a large toll on everyone around him, most
  dramatically his immediate family
* Christopher is sad to find out that his neighbor's dog Wellington has
  been killed. He is determined to investigate. His neighbor's name is
  Ms. Shears.
* Christopher's Dad is the one who killed Wellington. He has also been
  lying about the death of Christopher's mother. These are both related
  to the fact that the neighbor's husband had an affair with
  Christopher's mother and they both ran away
* Christopher is scared because he thinks his Dad is also capable of
  killing him, so he runs away to be with his Mother in London.
* The book ends on uncertain terms when Christopher's mom chooses him
  over Mr. Shears, but doesn't end up with Christopher's dad either, so
  Christopher and his Mom move in to a spot together and he continues to
  attend his special school.
