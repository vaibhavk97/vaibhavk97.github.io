*TL;DR*: "Pino Lella's story as a young Italian man during World War 2. Slightly
worse than The Nightingale but great story nonetheless. Starting to warm up to
war story genre. Strong characters."

## Plot

Pino Lella wants nothing to do with the war or the Nazis. He’s a normal Italian
teenager—obsessed with music, food, and girls—but his days of innocence are
numbered. When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins
an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a
beautiful widow six years his senior.

In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German
soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is
injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal
driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the
Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.

Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command,
Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in
secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams
they will one day share.

## Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "Decimation functions psychologically," Leyers explained. "It's designed to
  quell the threat of revolt through abject fear. But historically, using
  brutality against civilians in reprisal breeds more hatred than obedience."

  "Anna kissed him a fourth time. Pino thought he heard a woodwind join the
  strings vibrating in his chest, and his mind and body were reduced to one
  thing, to the music of Anna-Marta and nothing more." (250)

  "How do you find happiness?" [Pino]
  Anna paused, then said, "You start by looking right around you for the
  blessings you have. When you find them, be grateful." (260)
