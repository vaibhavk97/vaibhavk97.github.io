summary: "Human-imitative AI is not a good way to frame current progress in AI. Intelligence Augmentation and Intelligence Infrastructure present an equally important (and as-yet-unnamed) class of problems."

## Notes

* Don't evaluate AI as if it's completely greenfield. Compare to the
  past.
  * I don't agree with this personally but I see where the author is
    coming from. I think this is hindsight bias
  * Whereas civil engineering and chemical engineering were built on
    physics and chemistry, this new engineering discipline will be built
    on ideas that the preceding century gave substance to — ideas such
    as “information,” “algorithm,” “data,” “uncertainty,” “computing,”
    “inference,” and “optimization.” Moreover, since much of the focus
    of the new discipline will be on data from and about humans, its
    development will require perspectives from the social sciences and
    humanities.
* This confluence of ideas and technology trends has been rebranded as
  “AI” over the past few years. This rebranding is worthy of some
  scrutiny.
  * I do agree with this. I think there isn't so much of a "revolution"
    as just good progress in a good field
* **Intelligence Augmentation**: computation and data used to create
  services that augment human intelligence and creativity, i.e. a really
  good search engine or a sound generator
* **Intelligent Infrastructure**: a web of computation, data, and
  physical entites exists that makes human environments more supportive,
  interesting, and safe. Medicine, transportation, etc.
* **Is working on classical human-imitative AI the best or only way to
  focus on these larger challenges?**
  * Has not been very successful
  * Success in human-imitative AI may not be enough for IA and II
    problems. Lots of additional challenges, namely engineering
    and scaling problems.
  * **We need to realize that the current public dialog on AI — which
  focuses on a narrow subset of industry and a narrow subset of
  academia — risks blinding us to the challenges and opportunities that
  are presented by the full scope of AI, IA and II.**
