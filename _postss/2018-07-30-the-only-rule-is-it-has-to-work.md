summary: "Entertaining story of what happened when two stat-heads advised an independent pro baseball team for a summer."
---

*TL;DR*: Ben and Sam learn that baseball is more than just numbers. Good
real-life, down-to-Earth sports story. Some great characters.

## Notes

* Ben and Sam, baseball bloggers and podcasters, become "special
  advisors to the general manager" for the Sonoma Stompers, an
  independent league baseball team in NorCal.
  * _There were no rules, except for one that our players demanded:
    Whatever we tried had to work._ (6)
* GM: Theo Fightmaster.
* Get major-league level tracking and analytics by calling in favors
  from STATS and BATS
* Goal: beat the San Rafael Pacifics for the championship (4 team
  league)
* Have to find "spreadsheet guys"
* Clash with Feh, a more "old-fashioned" manager
* Really strong start to the season, win the first half running away
* Get manager Feh fired, new manager Yoshi is more receptive to
  analytics
* Sean Conroy, first openly gay pro baseball playeer
  * Pitches a complete game shutout on Pride Night
* Eventually lose to San Rafael in the championship game :(

## Snippets

<blockquote>
  <p>
    [Theo] wants badly to win [...] but he's not selling a winning club.
    He's selling the small-town experience of being at a ballpark on a
    mild summer night. "The owners's objective," he tells me, "is
    basically this vision of a family of four leaving the game, the kids
    got to high-five the mascot, they got a foul ball, they're walking
    to their car and saying, 'What a fantastic night at the park. By the
    way, who won?'" (15)

<blockquote>

    Start a star sticker chart. 10 stars and you get a burrito. Use food
    to your advantage. Stars can be given for anything you want to
    reinforce. Yes, I'm treating them like 4-year-olds. The first rule
    of child psychology is that it applies throughout all of life. They
    will scoff at it and three days later be checking out how many stars
    they have. (73)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    What we think of as chemistry pervades every action [...] He shows a
    hint of disappointment that a postworkout batting practice is just
    soft tosses, not live pitching? Big League. He is all but cut by the
    end of that Opening Night banquet, because you can't have Big
    League in your clubhouse, bro. (90)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The only thing necessary for the triumph of Feh was for us to do
    nothing, so when I dropped by objection, the matter was essentially
    settled. Walker would make the team as long as someone didn't demand
    the ball even more forcefully before first pitch. Next time someone
    tries to tell you to "put yourself out there" -- join an online
    dating site after a bad breakup, maybe, or interview for a job whose
    requirements you can't quite meet -- remember Matt Walker, the
    patron saint of putting oneself out there. Walker went from total
    stranger to Opening Day starter in the span of ten days, just by
    being around. (116)

    The other guy lives in a big house, too. Not all failure corresponds
    to a lack of effort. Or a lack of desire. Or a lack of preparation.
    Or a lack of skill. We lose, sometimes, because the other guy is
    also really good. (282)

    We haven't lost our belief that data can help people build better
    baseball teams. We've just gained a greater appreciation for how
    hard it can be to collect and communicate. (332)
