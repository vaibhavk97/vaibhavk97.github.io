## Notes

* Culture spreads by assimilation and association
* Customer satisfaction begins with happy employees which begins with the hiring
process
* Integrity
* Priority: explicit learning. Ask people what they would go back and tell their
younger self
* Huffington: compassionate directness
* Ask about a time when someone was unhappy
