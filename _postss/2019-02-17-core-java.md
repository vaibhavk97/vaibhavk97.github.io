summary: "More of a reference book than a read-through book. Goes through the Java core API. Already knew most of it"

*TL;DR*: More of a reference book than a read-through book. Goes through the Java core API

## Notes

Note: skipped over Ch 10-14 (Graphics, Events, UI, Deployments, Concurrency)

### 1: An Introduction to Java

* Buzzwords from white paper:
  * Simple
  * Object-oriented
  * Distributed
  * Robust
  * Secure
  * Architecture-Neutral
    * Can run on many processors given the presence of the JVM. Compiler
      generates bytecode
  * Portable
  * Interpreted
  * High-performance
  * Multithreaded
  * Dynamic

### 2: The Java Programming Environment

* Primitives: int (4 bytes), short (2 bytes), long (8 bytes), byte (1 byte),
  float (4 bytes), double (8 bytes), char (1 byte), boolean (1 bit)

### 3: Fundamental Programming Structures in Java

* Declare variables where they are used
* Strings are immutable
* Can memorize print format characters or time format characters if ever
  inclined
  * Should do regex at some point too
* labeled break: break out of outer loop

### 4: Objects and Classes

* OO-programming: data then algorithms
* Object has behavior, state, and identity
  * what you can do with the object
  * how the object reacts when behavior is invoked
  * how to distinguish object from others with same behavior/state
* Classes are nouns, methods are verbs
* Implicit parameter of an instance method is the instance (target, receiver)
* Always use clone to return a copy of a mutable field
* Static methods when method doesn't need access to object state
* Method:
  * Cannot modify parameter of primitive type
  * Can change state of object parameter
  * Cannot make pobject parameter refer to new object
* list.add(3) autoboxes to list.add(Integer.valueOf(3))

### 5: Inheritance

### 6: Interfaces, Lambda Expressions, and Inner Classes

* Interface: benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding complexities and
  inefficiencies
* Lambda: block of code that can be passed around to use later, once or many
  times
  * Deferred execution

### 7: Exceptions, Assertions, and Logging

* RuntimeException comes from programming error. Any other exception is because
  something happened to your otherwise good program
* Use the finally clause to close a resource

### 8: Generic Programming

* Generics get wild
* Raw type is created whenever generic is defined
  * Type variables erased and replaced by their bounding types
* Wildcard type allows type parameter to vary
  * Example: Pair<? extends Employee>

### 9: Collections
