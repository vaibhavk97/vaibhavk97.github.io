## Notes

* 1 engineer: 12-14 hours a day coding, woohoo
* 2-10 engineers: 60% coding ,40% hiring. Player-coach
* 11-50 engineers: At this point, I believe technical co-founders have a binary
  choice: Stay on the technical track and hire a professional manager (usually
  given the VP of Engineering title), or give up coding and focus on the
  management aspects yourself. It really isnâ€™t possible to do both.
* By the time we reached around 50 engineers, I was spending 60% of my time
  being the best manager I possibly could to my direct reports, and training
  other engineering managers in the team to do the same. The remaining 40% of my
  time was spent recruiting.
* _My enjoyment now comes less from the things I do myself and more from the
  impact that I helped others to have._
