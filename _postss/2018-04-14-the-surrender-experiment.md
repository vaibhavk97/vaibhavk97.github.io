summary: "A memoir about finding enlightenment through Buddhist meditation, and how that brought fortune to the other areas in the author's life. Well-told, but I wasn't able to fully get past my initial skepticism."

*TL;DR*: The "flow of events" in Michael's life, and how it was impacted
by his spiritual journey: from living alone in the woods, to success as
a software entrepreneur, to an FBI raid and trial. Fantastic,
well-written story but just wasn't enough to get me past my (admittedly
deep-seated) initial skepticism.

## Notes

* Soo...Singer credits all of his wild success and happiness to this
  concept of **"surrender" -- giving up control to life to see where its
  flow leads.**
* I'm a pretty rational, logical person so this premise automatically
  raises from red flags for me. While Singer's story is fantastic, this
  one case study does little to sway my own worldview.
  * Clarify -- there is certainly merit to not getting caught up in
    little (or even big) things, but I don't see completely ceding
    control as the optimal way there. Just don't worry about things you
    can't control and I think that's a good place to be.
* I felt like many of the examples of "surrender" weren't exactly that
  wild...they **could be reframed less dramatically** as "going out of my
  comfort zone for the purposes of growth".
* I do see the merit in meditation/yoga to clear the mind. I've dabbled
  in it a bit lately and have noticed an improvement in my thinking. To
  me, the **power of clarity of thought** is the more important takeaway
  from this book. This leads to an easier life.
* Are my **personal preferences a net negative or a net positive**? Hmm,
  something I hadn't considered before.

    It's as though we actually believe that the world around us is
    supposed to manifest in accordance to our own likes and dislikes
    [...] this is an extremely difficult way to live, and it is the
    reason we feel that we are always struggling with life. (4)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It was overwhelming at times, but I never lost the perspective of
    watching a voice talking inside. It was obvious it wasn't me; it was
    something I was watching. (12)

  <p>
    The sounds were out there, but they seemed so far away from where I
    was seated inside. A **moat of thick peace** allowed nothing to reach
    the citadel of my elevated state. (21)

    I knew where thoughts came from, but where did inspiration come
    from? [...] It came spontaneously, in total silence, with no effort

    I had not done these things -- they had happened to me. In fact, if

    First, you let go of the personal reactions of like and dislike that
    form inside your mind and heart; and second, with the resultant
    sense of clarity, you simply **look** to see what is being asked of you
    by the situation unfolding in front of you. (64)

<blockquote>
  <p>
    There was the logical, thought-driven mind that links together what
    we already know into complex patterns of thought [...] Then there
    was the intuitive, inspiration-driven mind that can look at a
    problem and instantly see a creative solution. (150)

    Since I had absolutely no idea what was going on, thinking about it
