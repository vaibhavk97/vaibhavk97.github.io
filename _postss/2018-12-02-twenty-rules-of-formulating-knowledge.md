## Notes

* Do not learn if you do not understand
* Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to
  build an overall picture of the learned knowledge.
* Stick to the minimum information principle
  * We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible!
* Use imagery
* **Use mnemonic techniques**
* Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
* **Avoid sets and enumerations**
  * A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks
    for the list of the members of a set.
  * You should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way
    at each repetition.
  * Use enumerations instead of sets
  * Use overlapping close deletions instead of enumerations
    * Enumerations require hacks that will fail you at times
* The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time
  the right bulb in your brain lights up.
* Personalize and provide examples
