## Notes

* _Software is a special snowflake in the project management world [...]
  It is an unsolved problem that nobody has managed to get correct
  because understanding the psychology of how software developers work
  plays a much more significant role._
* _**Waterfall** thrives in environments where everything can be planned up
  front. Construction is a good example, where you can have architects
  draw up plans for a building complete with resources needed. The cost
  of resources, time to acquire them, aorder of assembly, time to
  construct each phase, licensed professionals and necessary equipment
  can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy._
* _The goal of **Scrum** is to isolate chunks of work into sprints.
  Usually a sprint is a 2 or 3 week time period. The development team
  will meet, look over the backlog of work to be done, estimate how long
  those tasks will take to complete and then "commit" to what will be
  done._
* **Goodhart's Law**: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be
  a good measure."...you affect the outcome by paying too much attention
  to it. i.e. cutting corners because the "target" is a 2 week sprint
* **Kanban**: continuous software delivery
  * Visualize what you do **today**
  * Limit the amount of WIP
  * Enhance **flow**: just pull off the next highest thing from the
    backlog
* _**Kanban combined with about 2 hours per week of pairing gives you a
  very productive and workable solution for an accountable, productive
  software development process that allows your developers to maximize
  their focus and still swiftly adapt to the needs of the company.**_
