## Notes

* In the pursuit to outbid each other, their local targets even exceed
  ambitious national goals. 11 local governments published targets for
  their AI core industries for 2020. Accumulated, this would create an AI
  core industry of almost 400 billion CNY in 2020, exceeding the national
  target of 150 billion CNY more than twofold.
