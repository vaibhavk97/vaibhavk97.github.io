## Notes

* MDP has states actions transition functions and reward functions
* Partially observable stuff is where you can't see every part of state.
  * Chess is fully observable, battleship is not
* Update beliefs based on results of actions still, but be more cautious
  cause you don't have the whole picture
* Train with Bellman equation. Curse of dimensionality
