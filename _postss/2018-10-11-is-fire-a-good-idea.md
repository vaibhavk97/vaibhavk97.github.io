## Notes

* FIRE is attractive to engineer types
* FIRE is predicated on being able to retire early
* But living frugally, adopting the ideas of the FIRE movement with regard to
  early investment in index funds or ETFs, and remaining financially prudent
  throughout one’s career — these ideas are definitely a prerequisite to
  building career moats.
