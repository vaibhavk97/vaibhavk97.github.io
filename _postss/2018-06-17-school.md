## Notes

* Guest: T.K. Coleman
* Education begins with the results you the learner want to create
* When you choose not to go to college you get a ton of objections that
  your peers don't get
  * "What are you doing? What kind of entrepreneurship?"
  * College is cop out justification for anything
* "Just because it's paid for" is the worst reasoning. Consider
  opportunity cost always
* Set reasonable expectations so you don't disappoint people
