summary: "Chinese businessmen are superstitious yet still successful because maybe 'rationality' isn't all that."

## Notes

* But if rationality matters so much, how is it that an entire generation of
  Chinese businessmen could remain so superstitious yet achieve so much success?
* To explain this, it helps to understand that there are two commonly understood
  forms of rationality, and LessWrong is mostly concerned with only one of them.
  The two forms are:
  * Epistemic rationality — how do you know that your beliefs are true?
  * Instrumental rationality — how do you make better decisions to achieve your goals?
  * Jonathan Baron calls the first form — epistemic rationality — “thinking
    about beliefs”. He calls the second “thinking about decisions”.
* If you’re instrumentally rational, you don’t need to optimise for correct and
  true beliefs to succeed. You merely need a small set of true beliefs, related
  to your field; these beliefs can be determined from trial and error itself.
* Keith Stanovich laments that almost all societies are focused on intelligence
  when the costs of irrational behavior are so high. But you can pick out the
  signatures of rational thinking if you are alert to them. According to
  Stanovich, they include adaptive behavioral acts, efficient behavioral
  regulation, sensible goal prioritization, reflectivity, and the proper
  treatment of evidence.
* If I were to summarise the rough thrust of these books:
  * Don’t do trial and error where error is catastrophic.
  * Don’t repeat the same trials over and over again (aka don’t repeat the same
    mistakes over and over again).
  * Increase the number of trials you can do in your life. Decrease the length
    and cost of each trial.
  * In fields with optionality (i.e. your downside is capped but your upside is
    large) the more trials you take, and the more cheap each trial costs, the
    more likely you’ll eventually win. Or, as Taleb says: “randomness is good
    when you have optionality.”
  * Write down your lessons and approaches from your previous successful trials,
    so you may generalise them to more situations (Principles, chapter 5)
  * Systematically identify the factor that gives positive evidence, and vary
    that to maximise the expected size of the impact (Thinking and Deciding,
    chapter 7)
  * Actively look for disconfirming evidence when you’ve found an approach that
    seems to work. (Thinking and Deciding, chapter 7, Principles, chapter 3).
* It doesn’t seem like the sorts of rationality that LessWrong prizes, or even
  the sort of rationality explored by Kahneman and Tversky’s research matter
  that much when it comes to success in business or in life. I suspect that
  instrumental rationality, deployed in the service of trial and error, is
  ultimately what matters.
