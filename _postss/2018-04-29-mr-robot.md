summary: "Report on Geoff Hinton and his capsule networks"
---

## Notes

* Geoffrey Hinton is "the father of deep learning"
* Started researching perceptrons in the 90s, it was quiet for awhile,
  but breakthroughs came earlier this decade. Joined Google in 2013.
* CapsNet: **artificial neurons organized into layers that track the
  relationship between various parts of an object—the little space from
  a person’s nose to their mouth is the example Hinton gives**
* AI researchers make a shit ton of money, his network is pulling it in
  rn
* Comes from a super duper academic background. Has had a rough
  personal life (lost two wives)
* Canadian AI mafia: Hinton, Bengio, LeCun
* “We’re machines,” says Hinton. “We’re just produced biologically. Most
  people doing AI don’t have doubt that we’re machines. We’re just
  extremely fancy machines. And I shouldn’t say just. We’re special,
  wonderful machines.”
