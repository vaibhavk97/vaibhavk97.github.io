## Notes

* The long, slow SaaS ramp of death is that it just takes a long time to get to minimum critical mass.
* I will go out on a limb and put a general rule out there that says “There’s
  just not going to be that one thing, that flips you from the long, slow ramp
  of death, to the hockey stick inflection curve”.
  * It’s going to be lots and lots of little things. And I would argue that most
    of those little things will happen if you continue to view your business
    from your customer or user inward, rather than from the metrics you want to
    change outward. I hope that makes sense.
* But in the end, the thing we’ve learned here was really about quick to wow.
  So, we live in a world where our ROI becomes just minuscule, minuscule. So, if
  your path isn’t very quick to wow, and very quick to measurable result, you’re
  just going to lose people’s attention.
* And, we’ve just kept seeing that when they used our product they’ve got real
  revenue, and it kept us up. So, again, lots of great things in that values,
  you know, we told the customer story every week. every week, and we still do.
  Because what we do matters to the small business. And so, that kept us going,
  and our metrics kept us going. Because, while there was no silver bullet, there
  was a continuous improvement in the metrics.
  All the charts were kind of edging up, right? And all our spreadsheets showed us
  it could happen. We’ve got enough of the metrics working together. That thing
  could happen.
  And so, if your customers are telling you got something, and your metrics are
  continuously improving, stay on the long, slow ramp of death. But if either of
  those aren’t true, it is probably time to parachute off. [Laughter]
