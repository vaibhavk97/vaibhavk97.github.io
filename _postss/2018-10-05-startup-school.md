Helpful but mostly canned advice on how to start a company. It was good to
codify a lot of this knowledge in flashcards, and the speakers certainly
expressed the ideas more eloquently than I could have.

## Notes

* what is the most important thing to a startup? (Sam Altman)	build something people spontaneously tell their friends about
* why is it easier to start a hard startup than an easy startup?	interesting problems attract talent
* what are the four traits Paul Buchheit came up with as the most important traits in founders?	frugality, focus, obsession, love
* What are the three things that Michael Seibel attributes his startup success to?	Technical team. Don't spend much money. Ego was highly tied to startup.
* what is the best definition of your customer? (Seibel)	the person or party whose problem you are solving
* why is it better to start with a paid product instead of a free product? (Seibel)	you know that your users are using you because you are solving their problem instead of just because you are free
* what is the difference between an artist and entrepreneur? (Seibel)	an entrepreneur solves an actual problem with a product that is appreciated
* what is the first type of customer you should target? (Seibel)	the _desperate_ ones
* what is the correct way to provide a discount on your product?	"add in an exploding ""discount"" -- e.g. give the customer a 15% higher price, say AWS has given you a discount so you can pass that down to the customer, and only make that available for 30 days. this will come up in all of their internal discussions"
* what are the steps in the initial product market fit search? (Rusenko)	idea -&gt; prototype -&gt; launch -&gt; traction
* what are the steps in the continued product market fit refinement? (Rusenko)	monetization -&gt; growth
* what is an MRP in the context of product market fit? (Rusenko)	Minimum Remarkable Product
* what is customer renewal rate?	% of eligible subscriptions who renew
* why is customer renewal rate preferable to churn rate?	since churn rate is churned customers / total customers, it can be deceiving if your growth is accelerating (it will look lower than it actually is)
* what are the three key metrics to track product market fit?	returning usage, net promoter score, customer renewal rates
* what is net promoter score?	How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague? (0-10)<br><br>Subtract the percentage of customers who are Detractors (0-6) from the percentage of customers who are Promoters (9-10).
* what is the difference between pivoting and iterating? (Seibel)	pivoting is changing the customer and/or the problem (rare). itearting is changing the solution (common)
* what does BEM stand for in CSS?	Block-Element-Modifier
* what is design? (Tan)	creating things for users that work well and delight them
* what are the three elements of design that are important for startups? (Tan)	product design then interaction design then visual design
* what is the central question for product design? (Tan)	what's the problem and who's the solution for?

* what's the central question for visual design? (Tan)	how does it look?
* what should you write down for each feature as part of PM 101? (Tan)	what it is, who it's for, which problem it solves and how important it is
* Why is command language important? (Tan)	Writing has to be direct. Call to action has to be obvious. People do what you tell them to do. You just have to tell them.
* when is the appropriate time to start PR and content? (Ma√±alac)	after you've made something people want and are certain they're not churning. PR/content is not an appropriate form of user acquisition
* What is a good way to do a trust check?	Ask: how easy is it to share intimate things? What would make it easier?
* How do you perform humble advice seeking?	I'm working on XYZ, can you help me with it? OR<br>I messed up doing XYZ, can you keep an eye out for that?
* What is the top thing to understand from a 1:1? (Lew)	how the other person is feeling
* what are the two types of feelings to uncover in a 1:1? (Lew)	tension and energy
* what are 2-3 examples of tension in a 1:1 setting? (Lew)	frustration, disappointment, annoyance, boredom, stress&nbsp;
* what are 2-3 examples of energy in a 1:1 context?	excitement, pride, motivation, flow, learning

* What is a valid trait to associate with success? (patio11)	hustle plus at least one other skill
* "what are the only two things that are considered ""work"" for an early stage startup? (patio11)"	talking to customers and creating things that customers pay for

* "what is a ""friendcatcher""? (patio11)"	a skill or trait that attracts people to want to be your friend
* what is an example of a friendcatcher? (patio11)	the ability to cook; if you can cook, people will come eat and anyone who comes over to eat with you is a friend
* why are time horizons a competitive advantage? (patrickc)	most people get easily distracted/bored/discouraged, so just being willing to do the same thing for a long time is a kind of differentiation.
* what are the two ends of the curve to nail when pitching a startup? (patrickc)	super long-term vision (big exciting opportunity) and specific steps over the next year to make progress
* what is the reality vs. the perception of early startup sales? (bosmeny)	it's the _founder_, talking to users. founder passion trumps sales experience.

* why is it important to be explicit about which skills matter?	if you aren't, your engineers will decide for you. everyone biases towards thinking their own skills are important, so this will introduce a lot of noise
* what is the bullshit asymmetry principle?	The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.
* what's the dispute resolution system between Patrick and John Collison? (pcollison)	whoever cares more wins
* what are the two stories of a startup? (pcollison)	getting to product market fit, and post product market fit
* what should you focus on instead of metric pre product-market fit? (pcollison)	high-touch, high-throughput, qualitative feedback. Not many users, so you can look at everything
* what is the market size mental model to have as you approach product market fit? (pcollison)	there is a more or less fixed market size. you serve some %, and don't serve some %. you must create the go-to-market tools to get to the % that you don't serve. this is the best model for a growth curve; concentric circles, not hockey stick
* what did aaron levy tell the collisons about why B2B software is better than B2C? (pcollison)	consumer space is super amorphous, inscrutable, many times customers don't even know what they want. businesses are mostly rational and allow you to work backwards from a comprehensible point

* what are the key qualities of an early startup employee? (pcollison)	intellectually honest, cares a great deal, loves getting things done
* what is the calculation to run when deciding to hire a startup employee? (pcollison)	will this hire make us more responsive to users/the market? will it tighten our OODA loop?
* "what is the ""probably a bad idea"" document at Stripe? (pcollison)"	an annual document circulated around the company where employees are encouraged to add ideas that are probably bad but if they work out could be really good

* how should you end every investor meeting? (ralston)	never leave without next steps or a close
* should you make long-term financial projections when raising a seed round? (ralston)	no, no, no, there's no way to make it anywhere close to accurate.

* "what is a good use of the ""10 years in the future"" exercise as it pertains to a startup? (buchheit)"	factor out your startup and look at the landscape of exponential change. For example, if Facebook didn't exist, someone would have built a gigantic social network. There's an inevitability.

* what is the Impulsive mind phase of Kegan's Theory of Adult Development? (gross)	basically children
* what describes the Imperial mind phase of Kegan's Theory of Adult Development? (gross)	still mostly children. very selfish, transactional, unable to see the other side, leadership failure: can't get people to cooperate over the long term

* dsecribe the self-authoring mind (stage 4) of Kegan's Theory of Adult Development.	"Not driven by social affirmation. Has a consistent, independent frame of mind. Take responsibility for their own inner states and emotions (""I am feeling angry because you violated a value that I hold dearly"")"
* what is the leadership success of people with a self-authoring mind? (gross)	good for early stage startups
* what is the leadership failure of people with a self-authoring mind? (gross)	hard to learn from people; bad for scale
* describe the self-transforming mind (stage 5) of Kegan's Theory of Adult Development.	no longer held prisoner by their own identity nor tied to particular identities or roles. Think in systems, can hold multiple ideologies at once
* what are people at stage 5 (self-transforming mind) of Kegan's Theory of Adult Development best suited for?	managing a strong executive team or product at scale
* it's not hard work that burns people out, but rather <span class=cloze>[...]</span>	it's not hard work that burns people out, but rather <span class=cloze>the feeling that their work doesn't matter</span><br>
