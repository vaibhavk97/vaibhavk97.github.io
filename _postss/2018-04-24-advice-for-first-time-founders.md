## Notes

* **What are some things that you should've known as a first-time founder
  but did not? How did you learn them? How did they help?**
* Relied too much on other people's advice. Learned to ask the right
  questions to customers. **Customers made us successful.** - Claudio
  Pinkus, CodeStream
* Communicate. Everything is a no except for a yes from VC! For B2B:
  marketing is overrated compared to product-market fit - Fred
  Stevens-Smith, Rainforest
