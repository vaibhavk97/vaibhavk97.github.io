summary: "Markov Decision Processes are Finite State Machines with four key components: state, action, transition function, reward function. They run into the curse of dimensionality."

## Notes

* Everything depends only on previous state and action taken from state
* Four tuple: state, action, transition function, reward function
* Optimal policy gives best action for max reward from any state
* Very hard to train at large scale due to curse of dimensionality
