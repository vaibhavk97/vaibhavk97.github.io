## Notes

* Find a way to impact the value your company is delivering to customers.
  But, there are a few subtleties here:
  * Your customers are not paying you for your time (slightly different for
    consultants).
  * Your customers are not paying you for your education.
  * Your customers arenâ€™t even paying you for your individual output.
* This is why I struggle with scenarios where people discuss pay and work
  without considering value. If you want to increase your compensation
  over time, continue to put yourself in a position where you can deliver
  the most value.
