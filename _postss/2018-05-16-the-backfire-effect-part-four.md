## Notes

* Challenged identity triggers fight or flight
* Let's start from the beginning to cover context
* Marshal in ww2 needs to maintain morale to turn civilians into
  soldiers
* Change idea that America only wanted to help Britain and that Germany
  was inconsequential
  * Solution: Make a movie. Frank Capra
  * What's changing when you change your mind? No one knows
  * Study by Stoffer: no change in morale from Why We Fight films
  * Facts changed, opinions did not. Facts do not change minds/attitudes
* 2016 election study: no backfire. Thomas Wood
* Again, we are not rational beings.
* **Shared values create values which we protect by beliefs by cherry
  picking facts. This is the psychological digestive system. We often
  think of it as going the other way**
* Backfire is still very rare! Only in cases of identity
* Western educated industrial Rich democratic students: WEIRDS. Always
  used in these studies
