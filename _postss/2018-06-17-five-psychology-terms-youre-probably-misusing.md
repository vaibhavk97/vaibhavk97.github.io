## Notes

* **Bystander apathy**: more people see something, less likely someone gets
help
  * Started with Katie Genevese murder. 38 bystanders no one called police
  * Diffusion of responsibility and judging other people's reactions
    --> bystander apathy
* Your brain **isn't hardwired**, it's more like an etch a sketch. Can be
shaken up!
* **Statistically reliable** is misleading. Not replicable or reliable. 1 in
  20! Ew. P hacking
* **Personality types** are bad. It's a big spectrum
* **Steep learning curve** means it's easy!! A gentle curve would mean
  it's difficult...
