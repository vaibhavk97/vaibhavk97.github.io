## Notes

* Economist John List (also involved in Uber study!)
* Chicago experimental pre school for state of the art techniques for
  cognitive and non cognitive skills
  * Give parents homework too. Incentivize them with money.
  * Tons of hoops to jump through!
* 30 million fewer words for kids in poverty than affluent kids by age 3.
  * Also differing quality - affirmation vs. prohibition, word and sentence
    complexity
* Non cognitive skills are massive predictors of school success: attention
  span, focus, confidence, etc.
* Tune in, talk more, take turns for better child development. 3 Ts
