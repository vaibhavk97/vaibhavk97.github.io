## Notes

* The capacity of memory is extremely large; the bottleneck is retrieval/recall.
* _On average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I was using
  conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once a week. If I wanted to
  remember something for the next 20 years, I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per
  year times 8 seconds per card. That works out to a total review time of just
  over 2 hours for each card._
* _I'll only need 4 to 7 minutes of total review time over the entire 20 years.
  Those estimates allow for occasional failed reviews, resetting the time
  interval. That's a factor of more than 20 in savings over the more than 2
  hours required with conventional flashcards._
* First, if memorizing a fact seems worth 10 minutes of my time in the future,
  then I do it. Second, and superseding the first, if a fact seems
  striking then into Anki it goes, regardless of whether it seems worth 10
  minutes of my future time or not.
* Anki works much better when used in service to some personal creative project.
* Include sources and citations with all of your Anki cards so that you can
  identify misleading information
* Another useful pattern while reading papers is Ankifying figures
* Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible
* Anki isn't just a tool for memorizing simple facts. It's a tool for
  understanding almost anything.
* Put another way: to really internalize a process, it's not enough just to
  review Anki cards. You need to carry out the process, in context. And you
  need to solve real problems with it.
* One fun pattern is to go back to my old, pre-Anki notes on books, and to
  Ankify them. This can often be done quickly, and gives me a greater return on
  the time I've invested in now mostly-forgotten books
* It's like they're trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in French, but only
  know 200 words of French.
  * If people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the
    “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care
    of themselves.
  * I now believe memory of the basics is often the single largest barrier to
    understanding. If you have a system such as Anki for overcoming that
    barrier, then you will find it much, much easier to read into new fields.

* “Distributed practice”, meaning practice which is distributed in time, ideally
  in a way designed to maximally promote retention.
