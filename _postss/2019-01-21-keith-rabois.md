## Notes

* We cover a lot, but one thing we kept returning to was business strategy.
Keithâ€™s frameworks for gaining and building strategic power helped me clarify my
thinking on the topic, and his examples of contrarian thinking will hopefully
make you question some commonly held beliefs.
* What problem am I trying to solve
* How do I get the right people to solve it
* How do I convince people I've solved it
