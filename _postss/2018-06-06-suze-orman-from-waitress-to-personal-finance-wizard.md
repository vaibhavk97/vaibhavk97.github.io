## Notes

* Super outspoken woman
* Started at Buttercup Cafe in Berkeley as a waitress. Loved it
* A "financial advisor" lost the 50k she got from friends to
  start a business because he made bad investments
* She learned about finance and markets when she figured out why her money
  was going bad in the market
* Then became a sick stock trader by -- how else -- hustling her tail
  off
