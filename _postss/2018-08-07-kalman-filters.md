## Notes

* Track where something is
* Get glimpses: radar, bird flying around between trees
* Based on gaussian distribution
* Model motion as linear with gaussian
* Simple update when you have new observations. Only have sigma and variance. Efficient
* Magic: closed form update on gaussian. Deterministic
