## Notes

* Mission is to understand and improve human lifespan and healthspan (or quality
of life).
* Mastery and lifespan
* Wealth defined as the number of great people in your life?
* 80 is lifespan
* 40 is where healthspan starts to dip
* At 70 you're halfway done with healthspan
* You want more of both!
* Health compounds!
* Prevention > treatment
* Cancer spends > 80% of its life undetectable. You need to be aware that it
does not happen overnight
* Healthspan is composed of mind body and spirit
* Mind measured by executive function, processing speed, short term memory
* Body is maintenance of muscle mass, ability to carry out functional movement,
frequency of pain
* Spirit is sense of purpose and social support
* To increase healthspan, move these levers positively. Eating, sleeping,
exercise, stress management, drugs and hormones, learning to avoid harmful
behaviors
* 3 diseases: cardio disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease. These are main
causes of death outside drinking/smoking and suicide
* People who live to 100 have genetic advantages. Their genes code for proteins
which offer protection from the above
* Cyclic fasting > caloric restriction
* Wisconsin study shows that caloric restriction only works for monkeys with
already bad diets cause they cut out crap. No effect on healthy normal diet
monkeys
* Only rapomicin (drug) extends life 
* Next frontier is fixing aging like gray hair and muscle loss
* Autophagy is the backing concept for cyclic fasting. Self killing cells.
Collect the good parts get rid of the bad parts. Happens when you're hungry
* No clue how to optimize for autophagy. Can't measure in humans
* Benefits of lifting/exercise?
* Dense bones help prevent breakage
* Metabolic benefits are best. Help with glucose regulation, need to keep
glucose levels low and stdev low
* Don't anchor your ego to being right. Shed things when data says differently.
  Anchor it to knowing as much as possible.
