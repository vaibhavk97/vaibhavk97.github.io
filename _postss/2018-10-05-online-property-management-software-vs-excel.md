## Notes

* Excel was not made for trust accounting.
* Due to the lack of a central database with multiple components, you enter your
  data into one spreadsheet, then in another for tenant records, then another
  for receipt records etc. Talk about triple handling! So while itâ€™s easy to
  create a spreadsheet, trying to actually turn it into a fully operational
  trust accounting tool is not
* If multiple people are accessing different spreadsheets, you are unable to
  track who has made changes, if data has been deleted, or if anyone is shifting
  numbers around.
