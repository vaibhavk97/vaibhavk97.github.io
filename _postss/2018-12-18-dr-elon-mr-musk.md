## Notes

* Success comes at a cost. Does Elon Musk cross the line when it comes to how he
  treats the people around him in pursuit of his huge aspirations?
* The company had to move faster, Musk told his senior executives. He wanted to
  start production in July 2017, almost four months ahead of plan. Musk was
  excited by a particular notion: He had recently had a dream, people in the
  room recall him saying, in which he had seen the factory of the future, a
  fully automated manufacturing plant where robots built everything at high
  speed and parts moved along conveyor belts that delivered each piece, just in
  time, to exactly the right place. He said he had been working on such ideas
  for a while. “This thing will be an unstoppable alien dreadnought,” he told
  his colleagues, causing some of them to pull out their phones and Google the
  phrase.
* A previous employee remembered Musk saying that Tesla’s goal was to save the
  world. “He would get really emotional,” this person told me—and that’s why he
  sometimes seemed callous, “because what’s one person’s feelings compared to
  the fate of billions? Elon cares a lot about humanity, but he doesn’t really
  care about individual people all that much.
* Eric Larkin, who helped oversee factory software until he was fired in April,
  still feels a strong emotional and financial attachment to Tesla. He’d worked
  there for three years and was proud to be part of something that could reduce
  carbon in the atmosphere and “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable
  energy,” as the company’s mission statement puts it. “Tesla is the only
  company positioned to make this world a better place, to really improve the
  world right now,” Larkin told me. “And Tesla is Elon. How can you be bitter
  about humanity’s best hope?”
