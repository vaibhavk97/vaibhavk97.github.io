## Notes

* The common mistakes people make when working on a new project that prevent
them from getting it to the finish line.
* Be ruthless about cutting. Cut password resets, credit card expiry, etc
* Developers shouldn't fall in love with complexity but they do
* Yes there are edge cases, no you don't need to handle all of them up front
* Let the world push you into more complexity
* Things change. It's not a failure of yourself if your system from last month
isn't good enough to support you today. It means you designed the right system
for last month
* Beware the iceberg problem: 10% on surface 90% lies below
* Billing is a good example of this. Half a day to get credit cards working,
hundreds of hours for everything else
* Nix user auth, teams, invites, etc
* Deadlines are bad if accompanied by fixed scope. Flexible scope makes
  deadlines great
