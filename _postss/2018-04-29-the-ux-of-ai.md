summary: "Machine learning should be human-centered"
---

## Notes

* Buzzword: **human-centered machine learning**
  * Bring machine learning to _people_, don't just do it in isolation
* Why human-centered is important
  * **If you aren’t aligned with a human need, you’re just going to
    build a very powerful system to address a very small — or perhaps
    nonexistent — problem.**
  * If the goals of an AI system are opaque, and the user’s understanding
    of their role in calibrating that system are unclear, they will
    develop a mental model that suits their folk theories about AI, and
    their trust will be affected.
  * In order to thrive, machine learning must become multi-disciplinary.
    Machine learning is the science of making predictions
    based on patterns and relationships that've been automatically
    discovered in data. Needs human guidance to do this more and more
    abstractly.
* The role of AI shouldn’t be to find the needle in the haystack for us,
  but to show us how much hay it can clear so we can better see the
  needle ourselves.
