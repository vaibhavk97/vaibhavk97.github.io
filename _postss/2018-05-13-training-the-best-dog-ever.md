*TL;DR*: Five-week dog fundamentals training program.

## [Niko's Training Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i9wWl_ngaFmIG9bwCqN2xC_caScyl9n0VStNlBS914k/edit?usp=sharing)

## Notes

* **Reinforcement is a stimulus that increases the immediately preceding
  behavior so that it's more likely to occur in the future**. This is
  the training thesis.
  * Corollary (negative): Punishment is a stimulus that reduces the
    immediately preceding behavior so that it's less likely to occur in
    the future.
  * **Reward is a stimulus that uses positive reinforcement to increase
    your dog's immediately preceding behavior by trying to tell him
    "YES! DO THAT AGAIN!" in the future.**

### 2: Preparing for Dog Training

* **Leash tethering**: clip carabiner onto belt and go everywhere with
  dog.
* Training logs

  * Start filling out Niko's once ready to begin training.

### 3: Feeding, Potty Training, and Crating

* Crate should be a safe, happy place for your dog!
* Teach your dog that **he gets something really great in the crate when
  you leave (not when you return)**
* Return to crate exercise if dog backslides during training. Home base.

### 4: Week One: Fundamentals Training Program

* 10 skills:
  * Sit
  * Recall
  * Leash walking
  * Down
  * Stay
  * Stand
  * Settle
  * Release
  * Off/take it
  * Boundary training
* **Spiriting**: unlocking dog's personality
* **Ground rules**:
  * Have fun
  * Do the homework
  * You're always training
* **Four A's of learning**:
  * Stage 1: Acquired: first success ever
  * Stage 2: Automatic: 80 percent success
  * Stage 3: Application: generalized skill to variety of places and
    situations
  * Stage 4: Always: skill melds into everyday life
* **Three P's of relationship**:
  * Positive
  * Play
  * Pals
* Natural canine orientation is **visual, not verbal**
* Treat techniques:
  * Slot machine: random treats
  * Jackpot: give 5-7 treats for one good success, none for other
    successes
* **Recall**: lure at a distance. Add verbal cue.
* Add name to any positive cue, never to negative cue
* **Release**: drop leash and point to play area
* **Which hand** game to engage pupper
* **Be a tree** on walks to help with leash walking

### 5: Week Two: Training in Everyday Life

* **What gets rewarded, gets reinforced. What gets ignored, disappears**
* **Off/take it**: Just let him take treats from your hand and mark it
  with "good take it"
  * Give up what he has with "off"
  * Make sure to pair "off" with at least an equal value "take it"
* Informal heel: walk-stop-sit sequence over and over, small walks in
  between.

### 6: Week Three: Advancing to Verbal Cues

* Start adding verbal cues for your commands

### 7: Week Four: Completing the Foundation

* **Door boundary training**
  * Whenever I open a door, dog must wait for me to go through before he
    does
  * Start interior, make him sit at doorway, then cue "let's go" to go
    through
* Doorbells: if you ignore, dog will ignore. Make sure he doesn't jump
  on visitors. Ignore if he jumps.
* **Chill**: once dog is down, has to stay there
  * Keep treating as he stays inn down

### 8: Week Five: Reviewing the Basic Skills

* Has a quick guide to all the skills
* **Stand**: Start with sit. Lure to standing, treat. Then add verbal
  cue

### 9: Training Games and Activities

* Retrieve: go fetch and bring back. Can try training verbal cue "fetch"
  as well.

### 10: Clicker Training and Dog Tricks

* Replace the word "good" with a "click" sound.
  * Advantage: clearer, more distinct noise than voice. Doesn't change.
    Marks *exact* moment.
* Tricks to target:
  * Wave
  * Roll over
  * Sit pretty
  * Toy cleanup
