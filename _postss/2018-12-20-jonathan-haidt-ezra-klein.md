## Notes

* Haidt sees a generation warped by overparenting and smartphones and flirting
with illiberalism. He worries over a culture of "safetyism" that confuses
disagreement with violence. He sees political correctness on campus as a threat
not just to speakers' incomes, but to students' psyches. 
* Nothing is miserable unless you think it so. Nothing brings happiness unless
you are content with it
* Mental health problems are up. Point to hospital admissions for self harm,
which are constantly for millennials but way up for Gen z 
* Great untruths
* Fragility
* Emotional reasoning
* Us vs. them
