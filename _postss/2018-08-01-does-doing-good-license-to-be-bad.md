## Notes

* CSR: Corporate Social Responsibility
* Want to study if consumers respond to CSR
* Create a firm. Set up different jobs at different salries and also publicizing
  different amounts of CSR
  * Can increase applicant pool by the same amount as a 25% increase in salary,
    $11 to $15
* Moral licensing is using CSR to justify doing bad stuff
* Can even justify when they could have done something bad but they didn't
* Tax forms: remind people of charitable donations right next to their self
  reported income!
