## Notes

* Junior developers know one way to solve a problem, usually based on tutorials
or something they did in school. It’s almost certainly using some trendy
framework.
* Mid-level developers understand that every problem exists as part of a larger
system and worry about maintainability, code quality, and so on but still don’t
see the big picture. They tend to get more hung up on the process.
* Senior developers understand that nothing is without possible issues,
  downsides, and risks. Their choices are not about what’s cool or “correct”
  according to some book as much as they are about holistic risk management
  across the entire team. They care about what’s going to be easy to maintain,
  easy to teach, and easy to debug.
