*TL;DR*: Story of a kid named August who has a disfigured face who goes to
school for the first time. It's definitely a kid's book. I appreciated the
message a lot and it was well-told, but I think I would have enjoyed it much
more 10 years ago :)

## Notes

* Switches perspectives between kids throughout book
* August: "I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's
  probably worse."
* Friends:
  * Jack Will is poor but wants to fit in
  * Julian is the "popular kid"
* Vivian is the sister
* Justin is Vivian's new boyfriend
* Miranda is Vivian's old friend

  like a baby the rest of your life, or like a kid with special needs, you just
  have to suck it up and go. (36)
