## Notes

* The best way to read self help is to think of it as ‘technê’ — the old Greek
  word for ‘craft’, or ‘practice’.
* Optimise for usefulness.
* What is the ‘power test’, you ask? Well, difficult problems require powerful
  techniques to overcome.
* Principle of Believability here: prioritise testing ideas from more
  believable people. Spend less time on those who aren’t that believable.
* Self help is merely a way of taking advice from people I’ve never met.
