## Notes

* Best used as a reference for when I am in this position, nothing to anchor it
  to at the moment
* Quick wins:
  * Focus copy on them
  * Add pattern, texture, and shine to a block of copy
  * Defang objections with an "even if" clause
  * Limit each sentence to one idea
  * Create a landing page that's not your homepage
