summary: "The fewer things you keep in your identity, the stronger your identity becomes and the more fruitful discussions you can have about things outside your identity."

## Notes

* You can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn't
  engage the identities of any of the participants. What makes politics
  and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people's
  identities.
  * People can never have a fruitful argument about something that's
    part of their identity. By definition they're partisan.
* So! Personal life: keep your identity small.
  * If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of
    their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is
    to let as few things into your identity as possible.
