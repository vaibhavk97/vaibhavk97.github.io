summary: "The trials of a racecar driver named Danny, told from the perspective of his dog Enzo. Fine story, just wasn't super feeling it."
---

*TL;DR*: Enzo the dog tells the story of his owner Danny: Danny's career
as a racecar driver, his marriage to wife Eve, Eve's battle with and
eventual loss to cancer, and the subsequent custody battle for their
daughter Zoe. Solid but unspectacular.

## Notes

* This book was fine. Nothing too special, but a decent story from an
  interesting perspective.
* None of the characters were super relatable
  to me (married couple, little kid, etc.) but I definitely enjoyed the
  little moments between Enzo and Danny.
* Novelty of having a dog narrator wore off after awhile. Enzo was
  overly philosophical for my taste. The off-hand comments about silly
  things humans do were my favorite.
* Wholesome themes: **family, loyalty, love**. Dogs are a great medium
* to
  express these through :smile:
* Am I allowed to say that the themes and storyline were...
  inconsequential? Never really got a sense of magnitude or urgency from
  the book. Could probably predict the outcome from the beginning. Maybe
  I'm just a terrible person. Hard to juxtapose with The Nightingale,
  which I read immediately after.

## Summary

* Enzo the philosophical dog adores his human Denny. Denny races cars,
  and by proxy Enzo knows all about driving
* Danny gets married to a woman named Eve and they have a daughter named
  Zoe. Enzo must learn to share Danny with these new humans, but they
  come to an understanding about it
* Eve gets cancer. Enzo can sense it, but as a dog he is powerless to
  help or alert anybody who can help.
* Eve dies and her parents sue for custody of Zoe, citing the fact that
  Danny has an unstable career that (thus far) has not produced enough
  money to support Zoe adequately.
* Enzo must support Denny through this entire ordeal. Eve's parents try
  to pin a bogus sexual assault case on Denny. Eventually the entire
  thing gets resolved and Denny gets custody of Zoe.
* A Ferrari executive sympathizes with Denny's situation and respects
  how he handled it. He offers Denny a job, Denny's career as a
  driver takes off, and he is able to live happily with Zoe.
* Enzo eventually dies of old age, but the end of the book hints that he
  is reincarnated as a human like he always believed. He meets Danny, by
  then a famous racecar driver, and passes along a shared catchphrase.
  Wholesome :)
