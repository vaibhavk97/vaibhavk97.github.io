## Notes

* What is life? **Decision making quality** and **luck**
* **Motivated reasoning**: reasoning toward conclusion instead of truth.
  This is bad and it's a trap we often fall into.
* Being smarter is bad because you think you can combat your own biases
  * Can try and form accountability groups to keep each other
    accountable
* **Temporal discounting**: "if this happened a year ago how would I feel
  about it?"
