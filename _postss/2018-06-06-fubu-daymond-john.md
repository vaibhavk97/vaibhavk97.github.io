## Notes

* Started as a waiter at red lobster after high school. Friends would
  come home with college degrees and he questioned his own decisions.
* Wanted a brand that loved the people who loved hip hop. Other brands
  didn't want inner city kids wearing their stuff
* Started by making his own hats and selling on street corner. Kept
  growing and growing from there
* In '92 finally got serious. Quit red lobster
* Give free 4xl 5xl shirts to big dudes like bodyguards. Lots of exposure
* 300k in orders from clothes show. Snuck in with no booth. Mom took out
  loan on house to complete orders
* How You Built That: Len Testa Disneyland optimization app
