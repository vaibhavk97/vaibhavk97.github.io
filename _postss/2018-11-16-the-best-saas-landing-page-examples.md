summary: "SaaS landing pages should have a great header, social proof, a great
call to action"
---

## Notes

* What makes a great header?
  * Explains what it does and introduces what problem it might fix
  * Creates curiosity in visitors to learn more about the product as you can only fit so much info at the beginning of the page.
  * Avoids high bounce rates (people leaving without go beyond your Landing page)
* Examples
  * CrazyEgg
  * Lobe
  * Plutio: use demos!
* Social proof
* Great call to action
* Reference this for DyslexAI
