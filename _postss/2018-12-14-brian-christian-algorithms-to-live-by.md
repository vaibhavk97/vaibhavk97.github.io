## Notes

* Computational kindness, and the best way to schedule meetings
* How can we characterize a computational model of what people are actually
doing, and is there a rigorous way to analyse just how good their instincts
actually are?
* What’s it like being a human confederate in the Turing test competition?
* Is trying to detect fake social media accounts a losing battle?
* The canonical explore/exploit problem in computer science: the multi-armed
bandit
* What’s the optimal way to buy or sell a house?
* Why is information economics so important?
* What kind of decisions should people randomize more in life?
* How much time should we spend on prioritisation?
* Explore exploit problem
* Multi armed bandit problem
* Good form for life
* A key assumption is immediate feedback
* Restless bandit problem is np complete, when payouts are constantly changing
* Work dumber. In 2005 "worse" Linux scheduler resulted in actually getting more
work done
* Copernican principle is actually mathematically supported!
* Computational kindness :)
