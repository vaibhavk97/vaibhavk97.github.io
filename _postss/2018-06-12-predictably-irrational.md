summary: "How the human mind fails the people it is supposed to support"
---

*TL;DR*: The human mind sucks. A lot. And it sucks the same way very
awesome. Try to get ahead of that suckiness and (just maybe) take
advantage of it.

## Notes

### Ch 0: Introduction

* The contents of this book should help you re-think what makes people
  go and which systemic mistakes they make
* **Behavioral economics** constrasts standard economic theory. Standard
  economic theory assumes people behave rationally, which is just not
  true. So behavioral economics takes their systemic irrational
  behaviors and attempts to apply them to the market

### Ch 1: The Truth about Relativity

* _Humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We don't have an
  internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather,
  we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another similar
  thing, and estimate value accordingly_ (1)
  * _Most people don't know what they want unless they see it in
    context_ (3). Example: TV sizes. Hard to compare unless given a
    range of sizes and prices.
* _We not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to
  focus on comparing things that are easily comparable--and avoid
  comparing things that cannot be compared easily._ (7). Introducing
  "**decoy** Brad Pitt" (slightly uglier Brad Pitt) makes real Brad Pitt
  look much more attractive. People try to find small differences and
  use those as points of comparison even though they might be
  meaningless in the grand scheme of things
  * The Economist: when $125 for online subscription and _also_ $125 for
    online PLUS print subscription, it makes you ignore the print only
    subscription and just compare those two
* _The more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the
  cycle of **relativity**._ (20)

### Ch 2: The Fallacy of Supply and Demand

* _As Mark Twain once noted about Tom Sawyer, "Tom had discovered a
  great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man covet a
  thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain._
  (26)
* _The basic idea of **arbitrary coherence** is this: although initial
  prices are "arbitrary", once those prices are established in our minds
  they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this
  makes them "coherent")._ (27)
  * Example: people think about last two digits of social security
    number. This anchors them, and is very close to what they
    subsequently say they would pay for a certain bottle of wine.
* _Our **first decisions** resonate over a long sequence of decisions. First
  impressions are important, whether they involve remembering that our
  first DVD player cost much more than such players cost today (and
  realizing that, in comparison, the current prices are a steal) or
  remembering that gas was once a dollar a gallon, which makes every
  trip to the gas station a painful experience._ (38)
* _So you stand behind these people. Another person walks by. He sees
  three people standing in line and thinks, "This must be a fantastic
  restaurant," and joins the line. Others join. We call this type of
  behavior **herding**._ (38)
* Break anchoring by **creating a totally different, non-comparable
  experience**. E.g. Starbucks did everything it could to distance
  itself in consumers' minds from Dunkin' Donuts.
* _The sensitivity we show to price changes might in fact be largely a
  result of our memory for the prices we have paid in the past and our
  desire for coherence with our past decisions--not at all a reflection
  of our true preferences or our level of demand._ (48)
* Even knowing all this stuff isn't enough to keep you safe! _In our
  attempts to make sure that we end up with decisions that seem
  well-reasoned and thoughtful, we commonly undergo a lot of unnecessary
  mental gymnastics and justifications, particularly when the choices
  are large and significant._ (52)

### Ch 3: The Cost of Zero Cost

* _Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but **when something
  is FREE! we forget the downside.** FREE! gives us such an emotional
  charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more
  valuable than it really is. Why? I think it's because humans are
  intrinsivally afraid of loss. The real allure of FREE! is tied to this
  fear. There's no visible possibility of loss when we choose a FREE!
  item (it's free). But suppose we choose the item that's not free.
  Uh-oh, now there's a risk of having made a poor decision--the
  possibility of a loss. And so, given the choice, we go for what is
  free._ (60)
* Examples include people choosing free options that are markedly worse
  than even 1c or 5c options. E.g. Hershey's kiss free and truffle 5c.
  Truffle is economically a much much better deal.
* Free should be taken advantage of more in business, society, and
  politics by savvy folks.

### Ch 4: The Cost of Social Norms

* _When we keep **social norms** and **market norms** on their separate
  paths, life hums along pretty well._ (76)
* **Social norms exist outside of money.**
  * _When money was mentioned, the lawyers used market norms and found
    the offer lacking, relative to their market salary. When no money
    was mentioned they used social norms and were willing to volunteer
    their time. Why didn't they just accept the $30, thinking of
    themselves as volunteers who received $30? Because once market norms
    enter our considerations, the social norms depart._ (78)
  * _The conclusion: no one is offended by a small gift, because even
    small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from
    market norms._ (80)
    * _Offering people a gift, even a small one, is sufficient to get
      them to help; but mention what the gift cost you, and you will
      see the back of them faster than you can say market norms._ (81)
* Must be very very careful around the edges. Decide which side you want
  to play on and stick with it.
  * _When a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm
    goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are
    not easy to reestablish._ (85)
* Can take advantage of social norms being cheap and effective
  * _Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to
    motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more
    effective as well._ (93)
  * _The point is that while gifts are financially inefficient, they are
    an important social lubricant. They help us make friends and create
    long-term relationships that can sustain us through the ups and
    downs of life. Sometimes, it turns out, a waste of money can be
    worth a lot._ (97)

### Ch 5: The Power of a Free Cookie

* _When **price is not a part of the exchange**, we become less selfish
  maximizers and start caring more about the welfare of others._ (109)
  * Experiment: free starburst vs. 1 cent starburst. Free starburst had
    a 50% decrease in total demand
  * _Not mentioning prices ushers in social norms, and with these social
    norms, we start caring more about others._ (112)

### Ch 6: The Influence of Arousal

* Experiment: ask Berkeley students to answer a set of questions like "would you
  have sex with a married woman?". Ask first to "imagine they are
  aroused" and then asked same questions when they are actually aroused.
  * _We all **systematically underpredict the degree to which arousal
    completely negates our superego**, and the way emotions can take
    control of our behavior._ (129)
  * Honestly, best strategy to avoid making mistakes is to try not to
    get into these situations in the first place (lol who would do that
    tho)
  * Applies to all other intense emotions as well (anger, etc.)
* Obvious issue: completely ignores women. How much should that affect
  perception of results?

### Ch 7: The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control

* **Procrastination**: giving up on long-term goals for immediate
  gratification
  * Three classes:
    * No deadlines had worst grades
    * "Set your own deadline" had middle grades
    * Strict deadline had best grades
  * But don't necessarily want to be dictatorial
  * **Commitment in advance helps to prevent procrastination and help
    with self-control**
    * Especially if you publicize it
  * Can also combat by simplification, reducing cognitive overhead to
    perform tasks
    * Ford had 18,000 different parts that need maintenance at different
      intervals. Honda has same number of parts, but buckets them all
      into 3 service periods, which is much easier for owners to
      remember. Honda got way more cars in for service
    * _Simplification is one mark of real genius_ (151)
* **Immediate gratification**
  * _**Variable schedule of reinforcement** also works wonders for
    motivating people. It is the magic that underlies gambling and
    playing the lottery. How much fun would it be to play a slot machine
    if you knew in advance that you would always lose nine times before
    winning once, and that this sequence would continue for as long as
    you played? It would probably be no fun at all!_ (159)
* **Self-control and discipline**
  * _In order to overcome many types of human fallibility, I believe
    it's useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and
    positive reinforcements with the not-so-pleasant steps we have to
    take toward our long-term objectivs. For me, beginning a
    movie--before I felt any side effects--helped me to sustain the
    unpleasantness of the treatment._ (164)

### Ch 8: The High Price of Ownership

* **Ownership bias**
* Three irrational quirks
  * We fall in love with that we already have
  * We focus on what we may lose, rather than what we may gain
  * We assume other people will see the tranasaction from the same
    perspective we do
* _Once we change our possessions we have a very hard time going back
  down. As I noted earlier, ownership simply changes our perspective.
  Suddenly, moving backward to our pre-ownership state is a loss, one
  that we cannot abide. And so, while moving up in life, we indulge
  ourselves with the fantasy that we can always ratchet ourselves back
  if need be; but in reality, we can't. Downgrading to a smaller home,
  for instance, is experienced as a loss, it is psychologically painful,
  and we are willing to make all kinds of sacrifices in order to avoid
  such losses-- even if, in this case, the monthly mortgage sinks the
  ship._ (177)
  * **Very applicable to you Tiger!**

### Ch 9: Keeping Doors Open

* _Xiang Yu explained to his troops that without the pots and the ships,
  they had no other choice but to fight their way to victory or perish_
  (183)
  * Spoiler alert: they did
* _We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open. It's just the
  way we're wired. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to close
  them._ (194)
  * Experiment: multi-armed bandit experiment with three arms.
  * When all three options were available all the time, students made
    optimal choices and just spammed the highest-return bandit
  * But when doors had the chance of closing, they impulsively fought to
    keep doors open even though it's a suboptimal strategy
* **Deciding between two similar things** is super difficult
  * _What my friend failed to do when focusing on the similarities and
    minor differences between two things was to take into account the
    consequences of not deciding._ (195)
  * We don't take these consequences into account because we just can't
    close doors

### Ch 10: The Effect of Expectations

* _When we believe beforehand that something will be good, therefore, it
  generally will be good--and when we think it wil be bad, it will be
  bad._ (204)
  * Example: two opposing teams' fans are watching the same play, one
    fan clearly sees a foul, the other clearly sees a clean play
  * _We can add small things that sound exotic and fashionable to our
    cooking. These ingredients might not make the dish any better in a
    blind taste test; but by changing our expectations, they can
    effectively influence the taste when we have this pre-knowledge._
    (208)
  * Coke vs. Pepsi: Pepsi wins in blind taste test, but when people are
    informed which is which Coke wins because of superior branding and
    marketing
  * This creates conflicts
    * _Conflicts generally require a neutral third party--who has not
      been tainted with our expectatinos--to set down the rules and
      regulations. Of course, accepting the word of a third party is not
      easy and not always possible; but when it is possible, it can
      yield substantial benefits. And for that reason alone, we must
      continue to try._ (216)
* _We don't really understand the role expectations play in the way we
  experience and evaluate art, literature, drama, architecture, food,
  wine--anything, really._ (220)
  * Famous violinist "sounds better" in a concert hall because that's
    what we're expecting. If they were just bussing on the street we
    wouldn't really notice.

### Ch 11: The Power of Price

* _**Placebo** comes from the Latin for "I shall please." The term was used
  in the fourteenth century to refer to sham mourners who were hired to
  wail and sob for the deceased at funerals._ (228)
* _In general, two mechanisms shape the expectations that make placebos
  work. One is **belief**--our confidence or faith in the drug, the
  procedure, or the caregiver. Sometimes just the fact that a doctor or
  nurse is paying attention to us and reassuring us not only makes us
  feel better but also triggers our internal healing processes. Even a
  doctor's enthusiasm for a particular treatment or procedure may
  predispose us toward a positive outcome._ (230)
* _The second mechanism is **conditioning**. Like Pavlov's famous dogs, the
  body builds up expectancy after repeated experiences and releases
  various chemicals to prepare us for the future. Suppose you've ordered
  pizza night after night. When the deliveryman presses the doorbell,
  your digestive juices start flowing even before you can smell the pie.
  Or suppose that you are snuggled up on the couch with your loved one.
  As you're sitting there staring into a crackling fire, the prospect of
  sex releases endorphins, preparing you for what is to come next, and
  sending your sense of well-being into the stratosphere._ (230)
  * Experiment: dummy pain numbing drug "Veladone". _Indeed, that's what
    most of our participants found. Almost all of them reported less
    pain when they experienced the electrical shocks under the influence
    of Veladone. Very interesting--considering that Veladone was just a
    capsule of vitamin C._ (234)
* Price also influences the placebo effect. A $2.50/dose every patient
  felt better. At $0.10/dose only half did.

### Ch 12: The Cycle of Distrust

* **The Public Goods Game** (e.g. fishing)
  * Example: four people get $10 each. Whatever they put into the pot is
    doubled and then split evenly; if everyone puts in $10, everyone
    gets $20 back. But selfish strategy is to not put any money in
    yourself and just reap the rewards. But if everyone does this
    everyone loses.
  * _When we all cooperate, trust is high and the total value to society
    is maximal. But distrust is infectious. When we see people defect by
    lying in their advertisements, proposing scams, etc. we start acting
    similarly; trust deteriorates, and everybody loses, including the
    individuals who initially gained from their selfish act._ (256)
* _Most people and companies miss or ignore the fact that trust is an
  important public resource and that losing it can have long-term
  negative consequences for everyone involved._ (256)
* You slip into bad habits of lying slowly over time
* The Boy Who Cried Wolf: _The second, more important moral--one that we
  are just beginning to understand--is that trust, once eroded, is very
  hard to restore._ (264)

### Ch 13: The Context of Our Character, Part I

* Annual losses:
  * $525 million from robbery
  * **$600 billion** from employee theft and fraud
  * **$24 billion** bogus property insurance losses
  * **$350 billion** in unpaid taxes
* Experiment: if given answers, will students cheat on test? Get 10
  cents for each correct answer on a test of 50 questions
  * Control (no answer key): 32.6
  * Self-check: 36
  * Self-check + shred originals: 36
  * Self-check + shred originals + take money yourself instead of being
    given: 36
  * **Yes, we cheat. But we do not take risk into account very well**
* _We care about honesty and we want to be honest. The problem is that
  our internal honesty monitory is only active when we contemplate big
  transgressions, like grabbing an entire box of pens from the
  conference hall. For the little transgressions, like taking a single
  pen or two pens, we don't even consider how these actions would
  reflect on our honesty and so our superego stays asleep._ (276)
* External controls don't work...see Congress trying to police things.
  Always a loophole.
* Students try to remember 10 Commandments before taking the same test
  as before: _It was not the Commandments themselves that encouraged
  honesty, but the mere contemplation of a **moral benchmark** of some
  kind._ (281)
* _So we learned that people cheat when they have a chance to do so, but
  they don't cheat as much as they could. Moreover, once they begin
  thinking about honesty--whether by recalling the Ten Commandments or
  by signing a simple statement--they stop cheating completely. In other
  words, when we are removed from any benchmarks of ethical thought, we
  tend to stray into dishonesty. Buf if we are reminded of morality at
  the moment we are tempted, then wwe are much more likely to be
  honest._ (286)

### Ch 14: The Context of Our Character, Part II

* Market/social norms again: **people think less about stealing when it
  is indirect**
  * _When we look at the world around us, much of the dishonesty we see
    involves cheating that is one step removed from cash. Companies
    cheat with their accounting practices; executives cheat by using
    backdated stock options; lobbyists cheat by underwriting parties for
    politicians; drug companies cheat by sending doctors and their wives
    off on posh vacations. To be sure, these people don't cheat with
    cold cash. And that's my point: cheating is a lot easier when it's a
    step removed from money._ (295)
* Same experiment as Ch 13 with the test that students could cheat on.
  But now, instead of directly getting cash, they get tokens, which they
  go to a different table to exchange for cash
  * **More than double the amount of cheating**
* This experiment was on MIT students. _The scary thought is that if we
  did the experiments with nonmonetary currencies that were not as
  immediately convertible into money as tokens, or with individuals who
  cared less about their honesty, or with behavior that was not so
  publicly observable, we would most likely have found even higher
  levels of dishonesty._ (303)

### Ch 15: Beer and Free Lunches

* See if order in which people place orders at a restaurant affects
  their eventual happiness with the food
  * _Overall, those who made their choices out loud, in the standard way
    that food is ordered at restaurants, were not as happy with their
    selections as those who made their choices privately, without taking
    others' opinions into consideration._ (309)
    * Except the first person to place the order--he/she was equally as
      happy as the asynchronous order-placers
* _Standard economics assumes that we are rational--that we know all the
  pertinent information about our decisions, that we can calculate the
  value of the different options we face, and that we are cognitively
  unhindered in weighing the ramifications of each potential choice
  [...] the fact that we make mistakes also means that there are ways to
  improve our decisions--and therefore that there are opportunities for
  "free lunches"._ (314)
