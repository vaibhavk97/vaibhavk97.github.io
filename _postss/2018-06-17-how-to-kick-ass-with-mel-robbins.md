## Notes

* **5 second rule**: when you hesitate, count backwards from 5, and you only
  have 5 seconds to take action.
* Draw attention from basal ganglia to prefrontal cortex
* **When you're nervous tell yourself you're excited**. Same body chemical
  response but mind interpretation is different--no cortisol to the
  prefrontal cortex
* Relationships are about connection or power. Only works if both parties
  are in it for connection
