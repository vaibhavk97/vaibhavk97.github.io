## Notes

* Founded on language modalities, the phonologic attempt at understanding
  dyslexia is based on the lowest level of word sound structure, the phoneme.
  The phonologic theory of dyslexia implies an impairment of both retrieval and
  storage of speech sounds. Reading in an alphabetic language system requires
  understanding the relationship of sound to letters. This **grapheme** to phoneme
  (reading to sound) relationship is a core belief of the phonologic deficit
  theory. Phonemes are the smallest sound entities that distinguish closely
  similar words. Dyslexics exhibit phoneme unawareness.2,3
* Thus, dyslexia is often considered a language disorder in both single word
  decoding and phonologic abnormalities. With remediation treatment, dyslexics
  activate the language based phonemic area of the left temporal-parietal region
  similar to nondyslexics.2,4,5
* A visual origin theory for dyslexia seems a logical assumption when
  consideration is given to the fact that dyslexia is so closely associated with
  processing letters and words on the printed page. Dyslexia has been considered
  the result of unstable binocular fixation and vergence difficulties. Visual
  and ocular-motor defects would impair eye motor control, visual attention, and
  eye movement for visual searching. Thus, reading skills would be subject to
  impairment.
  Reading Method
* All reading materials are placed slightly off center toward the nondominant
  eye side. The index finger is now placed on the bottom center of the first
  line to read. The index finger is slowly raised until the words are clearly
  seen. Although the words were believed clear before, the words are now
  distinctly clearer and easier to read. Words will, also, be blacker, sharper,
  and clearer. The index finger is now quickly bent and slowly retracted while
  maintaining clear print. Reading should only begin after the individual is
  readily capable of using the index finger to “make-it-clear” with the printed
  page. In actuality, only 1 or 2 attempts are needed to find this new focal
  point and “make-it-clear.” This new, elevated, focal point distance needs to
  be pointed out so that they can readily find it for reading without first
  touching the page. Using the new focal point and with finger in place, this
  line is read aloud.  Immediate increase in fluency is usually apparent.
* The Positional Reading Arc is predicated upon the use of cyclovergence where
  on looking down the eyes rotate nasally and on looking up the eyes rotate
  laterally. Cyclovergence is to aid in the correspondence of both eyes for
  stereopsis.
* Two parts: positional reading arc and stereoscopic eye exercise

* Position C is perhaps the most versatile for the dyslexic. They do very well
  with straight ahead computer screen levels. Frequently, Position C individuals
  will rise up in their chair, lean forward, and read by looking straight down.
* 71% of the students from Grade 2 to Grade 8 stated that there was a better
  position; 21% chose Position “B,” 45% chose Position “C,” and 5% chose
  Position “D”
* Improvements in comprehension, speed, and word error
* The economic loss from dyslexia is incalculable and the social loss is beyond
  description. 
* The financial burden on education, the lack of a dyslexic’s obtainable
  economic and social potentials, and lower income expectations represent a few
  disadvantages burdened by dyslexics.
