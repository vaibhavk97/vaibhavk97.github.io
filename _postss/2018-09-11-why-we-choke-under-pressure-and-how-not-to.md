## Notes

* Sian beilock, from Berkeley, president of Barnard!
* Choking: worse performance than you would expect from an individual given high
stakes
* High IQ, best focus will choke more. If you normally have lots of cognitive
resources, pressure takes away more, and you are more prone to choke
* Skilled people do things on autopilot. Pressure makes you think too much
* Higher cognitive effort tasks are more conducive to choking
* Put yourself in realistic pressure practice situations: people watch you,
  record yourself
