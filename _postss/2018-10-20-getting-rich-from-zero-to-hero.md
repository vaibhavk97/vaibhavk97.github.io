## Notes

* Here’s how to cut your life costs in half. Start by getting rid of your Debt
  Emergency if you have one. Live close to work. Move to another city if you
  enjoy adventure. Don’t borrow money for cars, and don’t buy stupid ones. Ride
  a bike wherever you can. Cancel your TV service. Stop wasting money on
  groceries. Give your kids the opportunity to achieve greatness without being
  pampered. Lose the overpriced cell phones. Learn to appreciate the
  life-boosting joy of using your own body to get things done. Learn to mock
  convenience. Practice optimism.
* If you can get 25 times your annual spending saved up and working for you,
  that is enough to live off – forever.
* If you can save 50% of your take-home pay starting at age 20, you’ll be
  wealthy enough to retire by age 37. If you already have some assets now,
  you’re even closer than that.
