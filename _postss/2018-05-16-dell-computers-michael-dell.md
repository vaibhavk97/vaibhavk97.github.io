summary: "Michael Dell often gets lost in the shuffle of the Gates's, Bezos's, Zuckerbergs, but his story is just as important. Super sharp guy. Focus on customers, not competition."

## Notes

* Sold newspapers in high school
* Bought apple II to take it apart in 1980
* Started flipping computers in college. Someone told him he should be
  selling the computers he had built in order to reformat the actual
  computers he was selling at the time. The rest is history.
* **Three principles are global, b2b, service**
* **Focus on customers not competition**
