## Notes

* Try to get children and relatives experience in the industry elsewhere
  before hiring them. Otherwise can create a lot of resentment
* **First generation starts, second carries on, third ruins**
  * Same as immigrants!
* **Relatedness x benefit > cost** for nepotism to
  work
* Root nepos comes from Catholic priests having sons (but they're not
  allowed to have sex) and disguising them as nephews and moving them up
  the ranks
* Opposite of meritocracy. Always a pendulum and balance
  * If it swings too far one way it inevitably comes back.
