## Notes

* Groups sometimes underperform individuals
* Social loafing, etc.
* Stanford prison experiment was just one crazy guy acting bad
* Cognitive breakthroughs (from book smartcuts)
* To change you have to think differently
* Ask yourself questions to connect things
* How would X look at this problem (race car driver, ballerina)
* Force it to be 10x better
* It's not how well you get along it's how well you fight
