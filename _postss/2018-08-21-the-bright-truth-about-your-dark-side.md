## Notes

* There is positive anger, positive frustration
* If a coach gives an angry halftime speech but is not normally angry, it has an

* Entrepreneurs must balance harsh criticism with high praise and giving credit
* Guilt is about a wrong behavior. Shame is about your character. Criminals who
  feel guilt are less likely to recidivide
