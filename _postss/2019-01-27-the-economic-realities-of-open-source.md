summary: "Open Source financials echo those of the music industry; what's being sold is not the software, but the packaging. This is dangerous if left unaddressed."

## Notes

* It wasn’t necessarily “fair” that music industry sales plummeted, and yes,
companies like Apple with its iPod business made billions off of piracy. The
only reality that mattered, though, was that music itself, thanks to its
infinite reproducibility, was as pure a commodity as there could be.
* Right now everyone is winning: simply following economic realities could, in
  the long run, mean everyone is worse off.
