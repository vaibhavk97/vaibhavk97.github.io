## Notes

* **Turing test focuses too much on deception**
* Questions constructed that are tricky to guess and very clear: the
  trophy wouldn't fit in the suitcase because it was too small. What is
  too small?
* Change small to big and it becomes a different answer
* More objective than Turing test with this type of format and scoring
