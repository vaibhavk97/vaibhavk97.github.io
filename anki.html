  This is the home for my <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
  deck, updated regularly. The deck contains very similar (often overlapping) content to this
  site, and I use Anki to commit the important concepts to long-term memory.
  The deck was created on September 17, 2018.

  The deck is put together generally following the process outlined in
  <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Michael Nielsen's paper</a>.
  The two departures I've made are to a) tag cards according to topic, subtopic,
  and source mirroring the notes on this site, and b) share my deck publicly
  to create accountability (I have a separate Personal deck for potentially
  sensitive information).
