    Inspired from <a href="" Tiger></a> early 2018 I started this site to help myself think more effectively. I
    spent a lot of time studying, but was frustrated by how much and how quickly
    I ended up forgetting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most effective techniques I have found have been
    <a href="https://sivers.org/2do">compressed knowledge</a> and
    <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition</a>.
    This site's contents heavily reflect this; my notes are organized as
    full-text-searchable webpages, and my full
    <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> deck is published
    <a href="/anki">here</a> <strike>regularly</strike> whenever I get around to it.
    The tradeoff of consuming less and understanding more has made my work
    and study much much more enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling.

    While the primary purpose of this site is as a personal reference, it also
    ostensibly functions as a set of recommendations for anyone with shared
    interests, just like the many book lists and Twitter feeds I've trolled to
    find books and articles. The headers at the top are a good starting point.
    My generic star-rating system goes from 1 (waste of time) to 5 (legitimately
    life-changing), with 2 being "average". Each tag has its own page with items
    in descending rating order. If you know of any content you think I might
    enjoy, please shoot me an email!

      "The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff and
      blow, "is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You
      may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night
      listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you
      may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your
      honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for
      it then -- to learn." (T.H. White)
